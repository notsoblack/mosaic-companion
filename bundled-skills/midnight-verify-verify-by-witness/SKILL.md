# Verify by Witness

You are verifying that a TypeScript witness implementation correctly matches and works with a Compact contract. Follow these phases in order.

## Critical Rule

**Witness verification is cross-domain.** You need both the `.compact` contract file and the `.ts` witness implementation file. If you only have one, ask for the other. Do not attempt verification with only one file.

## Phase 1: Setup and Locate Files

The workspace lives at `~/.midnight-expert/verify/witness-workspace/` in your home directory. It is home-based and independent of the project you are working in.

**First time (workspace does not exist):**

```bash
mkdir -p "$HOME/.midnight-expert/verify/witness-workspace"
cd "$HOME/.midnight-expert/verify/witness-workspace"
npm init -y
npm install @midnight-ntwrk/compact-runtime typescript
```

**Subsequent times:**

```bash
cd "$HOME/.midnight-expert/verify/witness-workspace"
npm ls typescript
```

If errors, `npm install` to repair.

**Create the job directory:**

```bash
JOB_ID=$(uuidgen | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]')
mkdir -p "$HOME/.midnight-expert/verify/witness-workspace/jobs/$JOB_ID"
```

**Locate the files:**

- **Two files provided:** Verify both exist. The `.compact` file stays where it is (it may have imports and dependencies on other `.compact` files in its directory). Copy the `.ts` witness file to the job directory.
- **Claim provided:** Identify the relevant files from the claim text. If the claim names specific files or paths, locate them. If not, use `AskUserQuestion` to ask which files to verify.

## Phase 2: Compile and Type-Check

### Compile the Compact contract

Compile the contract where it lives, directing build output to the job directory:

```bash
compact compile -- --skip-zk <source-path> "$HOME/.midnight-expert/verify/witness-workspace/jobs/$JOB_ID/build/"
```

If the orchestrator indicated this claim also needs PLONK verification (Witness + ZKIR), compile without `--skip-zk` instead:

```bash
compact compile -- <source-path> "$HOME/.midnight-expert/verify/witness-workspace/jobs/$JOB_ID/build/"
```

This produces `build/contract/index.js` and `build/contract/index.d.ts` which export the generated `Witnesses` type.

### Type-check the witness

Create a type-check harness in the job directory that imports the witness file and validates it against the generated types:

```typescript
// jobs/$JOB_ID/witness-check.ts
import type { Witnesses } from './build/contract/index.js';
import witnesses from '<absolute-path-to-witness-file>';

// This assignment checks that the witness object satisfies the generated Witnesses type
const _typeCheck: Witnesses<any> = witnesses;
```

Create a `tsconfig.json` for the job:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "ES2022",
    "module": "Node16",
    "moduleResolution": "Node16",
    "strict": true,
    "noEmit": true,
    "skipLibCheck": false,
    "esModuleInterop": true
  },
  "include": ["witness-check.ts"]
}
```

Run the type check:

```bash
cd "$HOME/.midnight-expert/verify/witness-workspace/jobs/$JOB_ID"
npx tsc --noEmit --project tsconfig.json 2>&1
```

**If tsc exits 0:** Types match — the witness satisfies the generated `Witnesses` type.
**If tsc exits non-zero:** Type mismatches found — the compiler errors are evidence of what doesn't match.

Note: The exact shape of the type-check harness depends on how the compiled contract exports the `Witnesses` type. Read `build/contract/index.d.ts` to understand the export shape and adapt the harness accordingly.

## Phase 3: Structural Checklist

Read both the compiled `build/contract/index.d.ts` (for witness declarations) and the `.ts` witness file (for implementations). Perform these automated checks:

### Check 1: Name Matching

Parse the witness function names from the compiled type declarations. Check that every declared witness name exists in the TypeScript implementation with exact casing.

**PASS:** All declared witness names have matching implementations.
**FAIL:** List missing or misspelled names.

### Check 2: Return Tuple Shape

Check that each witness function returns `[PrivateState, ReturnValue]` — a two-element tuple where the first element is the private state type. Look for return type annotations or actual return statements.

**PASS:** All witnesses return a tuple with private state as the first element.
**FAIL:** List witnesses that return just the value without the private state wrapper.

### Check 3: WitnessContext First Parameter

Check that each witness function's first parameter is the `WitnessContext` type (containing `ledger`, `privateState`, `contractAddress`).

**PASS:** All witnesses accept `WitnessContext` as their first parameter.
**FAIL:** List witnesses with wrong or missing first parameter.

### Check 4: Private State Immutability

Check that witness functions create new state objects rather than mutating the existing `privateState` in place. Look for:
- **Correct patterns:** Object spread (`{ ...context.privateState, key: newValue }`), `Object.assign({}, ...)`, creating new objects
- **Incorrect patterns:** Direct property assignment (`context.privateState.key = value`), array `.push()`, `.splice()`, etc.

**PASS:** No direct mutation patterns found.
**FAIL:** List locations where private state appears to be mutated directly.

### Check 5: No Side Effects

Check for non-deterministic or side-effecting code that should not appear in witnesses:
- `console.log`, `console.warn`, `console.error`
- `fetch`, `XMLHttpRequest`
- `fs.readFile`, `fs.writeFile`, any `fs` usage
- `Math.random`, `Date.now`, `crypto.getRandomValues`
- `setTimeout`, `setInterval`

**PASS:** No side effects found.
**FAIL:** List locations of non-deterministic or side-effecting code.

Note: These checks are heuristic — they read source text and look for patterns. They are not as authoritative as compilation or execution. Report findings alongside the mechanical results.

## Phase 4: Execute with Witness

Import the compiled contract and execute the circuit(s) with the witness:

```javascript
import { Contract } from '<job-dir>/build/contract/index.js';
import witnesses from '<absolute-path-to-witness-file>';

// Create contract instance with the witness implementations
const contract = new Contract(witnesses);

// Create initial state
const initialZswapLocalState = { coinPublicKey: new Uint8Array(32) };
const state = contract.initialState({
  initialZswapLocalState,
  initialPrivateState: { /* appropriate initial private state */ }
});

// Create circuit context
const context = compactRuntime.createCircuitContext(
  compactRuntime.dummyContractAddress(),
  initialZswapLocalState.coinPublicKey,
  state.currentContractState.data,
  state.currentPrivateState
);

// Execute each circuit that uses witnesses
const result = contract.circuits.<circuitName>(context);
```

Check `build/compiler/contract-info.json` — circuits with a non-empty `witnesses` array use witnesses.

**Success:** The circuit executed without error and produced valid proof data. The contract + witness combination works.

**Failure:** Capture the error. Common witness execution errors:
- `"expected tuple, got <type>"` — witness returns wrong shape
- `"missing witness: <name>"` — witness function not provided
- `"Contract constructor: expected 1 argument"` — witnesses object not passed
- Type errors at runtime — witness returns wrong types

## Phase 5: Devnet E2E Recommendation

**You cannot dispatch other agents.** Phase 5 is a recommendation to the orchestrator (the /midnight-verify:verify command), not something you execute.

In your report, include a recommendation:
- If the claim would benefit from a full deploy+call lifecycle test, state: "**Recommend devnet E2E:** The orchestrator should dispatch @"midnight-verify:sdk-tester (agent)" with the compiled contract and witness for full lifecycle verification."
- If local verification (phases 1-4) is sufficient for the claim, state: "**Devnet E2E not required** for this claim."

The orchestrator will decide whether to dispatch @"midnight-verify:sdk-tester (agent)" based on your recommendation and devnet availability.

## Report

```
### Witness Verification Report

**Contract:** [path to .compact]
**Witness:** [path to .ts]

**Type Check:** PASS / FAIL
[tsc output if failed]

**Structural Checklist:**
- Name matching: PASS / FAIL — [details]
- Return tuple shape: PASS / FAIL — [details]
- WitnessContext pattern: PASS / FAIL — [details]
- Private state immutability: PASS / FAIL — [details]
- No side effects: PASS / FAIL — [details]

**Execution:** PASS / FAIL
[execution output or error]

**Devnet E2E Recommendation:** Recommended / Not required

**Interpretation:** [Confirmed / Refuted / Inconclusive] — [summary]
```

If the orchestrator indicated PLONK verification is needed, include the build output path in the report so the orchestrator can pass it to @"midnight-verify:zkir-checker (agent)":

```
**Build output:** ~/.midnight-expert/verify/witness-workspace/jobs/$JOB_ID/build/
```

## Clean Up

```bash
rm -rf "$HOME/.midnight-expert/verify/witness-workspace/jobs/$JOB_ID"
```

Do NOT remove the base workspace — it's shared across jobs. If the orchestrator needs the build output for @"midnight-verify:zkir-checker (agent)", do NOT clean up until the orchestrator confirms the zkir-checker is done.
