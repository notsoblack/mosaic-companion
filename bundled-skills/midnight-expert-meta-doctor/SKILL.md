# Expert Doctor

Comprehensive diagnostic and health report for the midnight-expert ecosystem.

## Usage

- `/midnight-expert:doctor` — run diagnostics interactively, offer fixes one at a time
- `/midnight-expert:doctor --auto-fix` — install missing dependencies silently, prompt only for upgrades and preference choices

## Step 1: Launch & Ask (concurrent)

Launch **all 5 diagnostic agents in background** AND ask the user a question — in a **single message** with 6 tool calls (5 Agent + 1 AskUserQuestion).

Each agent has `subagent_type: "general-purpose"` and `run_in_background: true`. Each agent must run its bash command and return **only** the raw output lines. Do not include markdown fences or any other text in the agent prompt beyond the instruction.

### Agent 1 — Plugin Health

> Run the following command and return only the output. No other text.
>
> ```
> bash "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/check-plugins.sh"
> ```

### Agent 2 — MCP Servers

> Run the following command and return only the output. No other text.
>
> ```
> bash "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/check-mcp-servers.sh"
> ```

### Agent 3 — External Tools

> Run the following command and return only the output. No other text.
>
> ```
> bash "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/check-ext-tools.sh"
> ```

### Agent 4 — Cross-Plugin References

> Run the following command and return only the output. No other text.
>
> ```
> bash "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/check-cross-refs.sh"
> ```

### Agent 5 — NPM Registry

> Run the following command and return only the output. No other text.
>
> ```
> bash "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/check-npm.sh"
> ```

### AskUserQuestion

> Would you also like to check Midnight Tooling status? (Compact CLI, compiler, devnet, proof server)

## Step 2: Handle Response

- If the user says **yes**: invoke the `midnight-tooling:doctor` skill (via Skill tool) and wait for it and all 5 background agents to complete.
- If the user says **no**: wait for the 5 background agents to complete.

## Step 2.5: Handle Agent Failures

If any background agent fails (returns an error instead of structured output), include a single row in the corresponding report section:

```
| <section-name> | FAIL | Agent error: <error message> |
```

Do not skip the section — partial results are better than silence.

## Step 3: Present Health Report

Parse all agent output. Each script outputs lines in the format:

```
CHECK_NAME | STATUS | DETAIL
```

Map each STATUS to a badge:
- `pass` → `PASS`
- `warn` → `WARN`
- `critical` → `FAIL`
- `info` → `INFO`

Present a single formatted report. Omit any section where all checks pass and there is an `ALL_*_PASS` summary line — only show sections with issues or mixed results. If ALL sections pass, show a brief "all clear" summary.

```
## Midnight Expert — Health Report

### Midnight Tooling (only if user opted in)
(include the delegated report from midnight-tooling:doctor)

### Plugins
| Check | Status | Details |
|-------|--------|---------|
| plugin-name | STATUS | details... |

### MCP Servers
| Check | Status | Details |
|-------|--------|---------|
| server-name | STATUS | details... |

### External Tools
| Check | Status | Details |
|-------|--------|---------|
| tool-name | STATUS | details... |

### Cross-Plugin References
| Check | Status | Details |
|-------|--------|---------|
| source → target:ref | STATUS | details... |

### NPM Registry
| Check | Status | Details |
|-------|--------|---------|
| check-name | STATUS | details... |
```

Do **not** show any intermediate bash output to the user. The report above is the only user-facing output.

## Step 4: Offer Fixes

Read `references/fix-table.md` for the fix recipes.

For each FAIL or WARN item in the report, determine the appropriate fix from the fix-table. Use the `platform` info line from check-ext-tools.sh to select macOS vs Linux commands.

**If `$ARGUMENTS` contains `--auto-fix`:**
- Apply auto-fixable items silently (installs, enables, MCP adds via `claude mcp add`)
- Always prompt before upgrading outdated tools — show current vs latest version
- Always prompt for MCP server scope (global vs local `.mcp.json`)
- Log each action taken

**If no `--auto-fix`:**
- Present each fix one at a time using AskUserQuestion with confirm/skip options
- Group related fixes when possible (e.g., "3 plugins need installing — install all?")

## Step 5: Verify & Summary

After applying any fixes, re-run **only the scripts whose checks had issues** to confirm resolution. Do not re-run passing scripts.

Present a final summary:

```
### Summary
- FAIL: N
- WARN: N
- PASS: N
- INFO: N

[If issues were fixed] Fixed N issue(s) this session.
[If remaining issues] N issue(s) require manual intervention.
[If all green] Midnight Expert ecosystem is healthy and ready for development.
```
