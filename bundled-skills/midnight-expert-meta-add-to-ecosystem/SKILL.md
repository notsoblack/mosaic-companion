description: This skill should be used when the user asks to add their project to the Midnight ecosystem, submit to Electric Capital, make a repo eligible for the EC crypto-ecosystems report, register a Midnight project, list a project in the EC report, tag a repo with `midnightntwrk` or `compact` topics, or add the canonical Midnight attribution to a README. Walks through the four Electric Capital eligibility requirements (on GitHub, public, `midnightntwrk` topic, optional `compact` topic), inserts the canonical attribution sentence into README.md, commits, pushes, and opens a PR.

# Add to Midnight Ecosystem

Walk the user's current project through the Electric Capital eligibility checklist and apply any missing fixes. Use the canonical text in `references/ec-criteria.md` — never paraphrase.

## When to use

- The user asks to "add my project to the Midnight ecosystem", "submit to Electric Capital", or anything similar.
- The user invokes `/midnight-expert:add-to-ecosystem`.

## Tools required

- `git`, `gh` (GitHub CLI, version ≥ 2.0 — required for the `--json defaultBranchRef,repositoryTopics` flags used in Phase 2), `jq`. If any are missing, abort Phase 1 with the install command.

## Skill state

Track these variables in your reasoning across phases:

- `branch_state` — one of `"existing-branch"`, `"default-branch"`, `"new-branch"`. Set in Phase 3, consumed in Phase 6.
- `made_readme_change` — boolean. Set true in Phase 5 if a file was written.
- `readme_pre_dirty_paths` — list of paths reported as modified by `git diff --name-only` at the start of Phase 5. Used in Phase 6 to refuse the commit if `README.md` had uncommitted user changes.
- `commit_convention` — `"conventional"` or `"freeform"`, computed in Phase 6a.

## Phase 1 — Pre-flight

Run these checks in order. Any failure aborts the skill with a clear next step for the user.

```bash
git rev-parse --is-inside-work-tree
```

If exit code ≠ 0: abort with:

> "This directory is not a git repository. Run `git init`, commit at least once, push to GitHub, then re-run this skill."

```bash
command -v gh
```

If missing: abort with:

> "The `gh` CLI is required. Install it: macOS `brew install gh`, Linux see <https://cli.github.com>. Then re-run."

```bash
gh auth status
```

If exit code ≠ 0 (not logged in): abort with:

> "You're not authenticated with GitHub. Run `gh auth login` and follow the prompts (we need API access to read and edit repository topics). Then re-run this skill."

```bash
command -v jq
```

If missing: abort with the platform-appropriate install command (`brew install jq` / `apt install jq` / etc.).

If all four checks pass, print:

```
[OK] Pre-flight: git, gh (authed), jq
```

## Phase 2 — GitHub repo check

Resolve the origin URL and parse `owner/repo`:

```bash
git remote get-url origin 2>/dev/null
```

If empty or not a `github.com` URL: abort with:

> "This repo doesn't have a GitHub origin remote. Add one with `git remote add origin git@github.com:<owner>/<repo>.git`, push, then re-run."

Extract `owner/repo` from the URL (handle both `https://github.com/...` and `git@github.com:...` forms).

Fetch repo metadata:

```bash
gh repo view "$OWNER_REPO" --json visibility,repositoryTopics,defaultBranchRef,nameWithOwner
```

Parse the JSON. If `gh` failed (e.g., auth or 404): surface the error and abort.

If `visibility != "PUBLIC"`: abort with:

> "Repository `$OWNER_REPO` is `$VISIBILITY`. Make it public via GitHub → Settings → General → Danger Zone → Change visibility, then re-run."

Extract:
- `existing_topics` — array from `repositoryTopics.nodes[].topic.name`
- `default_branch` — string from `defaultBranchRef.name`

Print:

```
[OK] On GitHub: $OWNER_REPO (public, default branch: $DEFAULT_BRANCH)
```

Persist `existing_topics` and `default_branch` for later phases.

## Phase 3 — Branch decision

```bash
git branch --show-current
```

Compare to `default_branch`.

**Case A — current branch is the default branch.**

First, look ahead and decide whether any work remains. Run these checks:

1. Is `midnightntwrk` already in `existing_topics` (from Phase 2)?
2. If the project uses Compact (run `detect-project.sh`, check `recommendation.add_compact_topic`), is `compact` also already in `existing_topics`?
3. Does the README already contain one of the three EC sentences? (Run `check-readme.sh`, check `present`.)

If all three checks pass: there's no work for Phases 4–6. Set `branch_state = "default-branch"`, skip the branch question, and continue — Phases 4–6 will simply print `[OK]` lines and the skill will exit at the summary.

Otherwise, use `AskUserQuestion`:

> "You're on the default branch (`$DEFAULT_BRANCH`). Create a feature branch for these changes?"

Options:

1. `"Yes, create branch 'add-midnight-ecosystem'"` (recommended)
2. `"No, work directly on $DEFAULT_BRANCH"`
3. `"Cancel"` — abort the skill cleanly with a brief summary of the Phase 1–2 findings.

If the user picks option 1: run `git switch -c add-midnight-ecosystem`. Set `branch_state = "new-branch"`.

If option 2: set `branch_state = "default-branch"`.

If option 3: abort.

**Case B — current branch is not the default branch.**

Print:

```
[OK] On branch '$CURRENT_BRANCH' — continuing on this branch.
```

Set `branch_state = "existing-branch"`.

## Phase 4 — Topics

Compare `existing_topics` (from Phase 2) to required topics.

### `midnightntwrk` (mandatory)

If `"midnightntwrk"` is **not** in `existing_topics`:

```bash
gh repo edit "$OWNER_REPO" --add-topic midnightntwrk
```

Print: `[FIX] Added topic 'midnightntwrk'`.

If already present: print `[OK] Topic 'midnightntwrk' present`.

### `compact` (conditional)

Run the project detection script:

```bash
bash "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/detect-project.sh"
```

Parse the JSON output. Read `recommendation.add_compact_topic`. The signal-to-recommendation rules are documented in `references/project-categorisation.md` — refer to it if you need to explain the recommendation to the user.

**If the script exits non-zero or its output isn't valid JSON**: treat detection as inconclusive. Skip the recommendation marker — present both options as equal and add a short note to the user that automatic detection failed and they should pick based on their own knowledge of the project.

If `"compact"` is already in `existing_topics`: print `[OK] Topic 'compact' present` and skip the rest of this section (no question, no edit).

Otherwise, use `AskUserQuestion`:

> "Does this project use Compact?"

Options (mark the recommended one):

1. `"Yes, add 'compact' topic"` — recommended if `add_compact_topic == true`
2. `"No, skip 'compact' topic"` — recommended if `add_compact_topic == false`
3. `"Cancel"` — abort the skill cleanly with a summary of what's been done so far (e.g., `midnightntwrk` topic was already applied if you reached this point and it was missing).

If the user picks option 1 and `"compact"` is not already in `existing_topics`:

```bash
gh repo edit "$OWNER_REPO" --add-topic compact
```

Print `[FIX] Added topic 'compact'` or `[OK] Topic 'compact' present` accordingly.

If `gh repo edit` fails (e.g., the user lacks admin permission), surface the error and continue to Phase 5 — don't abort. Topic edits are independent of the README work.

## Phase 5 — README attribution

Snapshot the working tree's modified paths **before** doing anything to the README:

```bash
git diff --name-only > /tmp/add-to-ecosystem-pre-snapshot.txt
git diff --cached --name-only >> /tmp/add-to-ecosystem-pre-snapshot.txt
```

Persist this list as `readme_pre_dirty_paths`.

Run the README check:

```bash
bash "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/check-readme.sh"
```

Parse the JSON. If the script exits non-zero or output isn't valid JSON: tell the user the README check couldn't be completed and ask them to either fix the issue (e.g., create `README.md` if it's missing — though `check-readme.sh` already handles that case) or skip the README phase. Don't proceed silently.

**If `present == true`**: look up the full sentence text using the table below, then print `[OK] README contains "<full sentence text>"`. Skip to the summary (no Phase 6 work — `made_readme_change` stays false).

| `matched_sentence` | Full sentence |
|---|---|
| `built-on` | This project is built on the Midnight Network. |
| `integrates` | This project integrates with the Midnight Network. |
| `extends` | This project extends the Midnight Network with additional developer tooling. |

**If `present == false`**: continue.

Run detection again (cached value from Phase 4 is fine) to get `recommendation.category`. If detection failed in Phase 4, present all three options without a recommendation and add a note. Otherwise, translate to display text using `references/ec-criteria.md`:

| `category` | Display label | Sentence |
|---|---|---|
| `built-on` | "Built on Midnight" | `This project is built on the Midnight Network.` |
| `integrates` | "Integrates with Midnight" | `This project integrates with the Midnight Network.` |
| `extends` | "Extends Midnight" | `This project extends the Midnight Network with additional developer tooling.` |

Use `AskUserQuestion` with the question:

> "Pick the attribution sentence for this project's README. (Recommended: $RECOMMENDED_LABEL)"

Show all three options (each labelled with the category and the verbatim sentence) plus a fourth `"Cancel"` option. Mark the recommendation. The user is free to override.

If the user picks `Cancel`, abort the skill cleanly with a summary of what's been done so far.

Otherwise, build the alert block:

```
> [!NOTE]
> {chosen sentence}
```

with one blank line before and one blank line after.

Decide the insertion point using the JSON from `check-readme.sh`:

- `placement == "top-of-file"`:
  - File doesn't exist: write the alert + `\n` to a new `README.md`.
  - File exists and is empty: write the alert + `\n`.
  - File exists with content: prepend the alert (alert + blank line + existing content).
- `placement == "after-title-block"`: insert the alert at line `title_block_end_line + 1` (1-indexed). Ensure exactly one blank line precedes and follows.
- `placement == "ambiguous"`: use `AskUserQuestion` with options:
  1. `"Insert after the H1 title (line $FIRST_H1)"` — recommended
  2. `"Insert at the very top of the file"`
  3. `"I'll add it myself — skip the README edit"`
  Apply the chosen action, or skip if option 3.

For all in-file edits, prefer the `Edit` tool with a unique `old_string` (use a few lines of surrounding context from `README.md` to make it unique). Do not use `sed -i` — it's not portable and obscures the change.

After writing the file, set `made_readme_change = true` and persist the chosen `category` and `sentence` for the commit message.

Print: `[FIX] Inserted "$category" attribution into README.md.`

## Phase 6 — Commit, push, PR

If `made_readme_change == false`, skip this phase entirely — print the summary and stop.

### 6a — Detect commit convention

```bash
bash "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/detect-commit-convention.sh"
```

The script inspects the last 30 non-merge commits, counts how many start with a Conventional Commits prefix (`feat`, `fix`, `chore`, `docs`, `refactor`, `test`, `build`, `ci`, `perf`, `style`, `revert`, optionally with `(scope)`, then `:`), and emits JSON like `{"convention": "conventional", "matches": 18, "total": 30, "threshold": 0.6}`. If the ratio meets the threshold, `convention` is `"conventional"`; otherwise `"freeform"`. A brand-new repo with zero commits returns `"freeform"`.

If the script exits non-zero or the output isn't valid JSON, default `commit_convention` to `"freeform"` and continue.

Set `commit_convention` from the script's `convention` field.

Build the commit message:

- `conventional`:
  ```
  docs: add Midnight Network attribution for Electric Capital

  Adds the canonical Electric Capital attribution sentence to README.md.
  ```
- `freeform`:
  ```
  Add Midnight Network attribution for Electric Capital

  Adds the canonical Electric Capital attribution sentence to README.md.
  ```

### 6b — Stage only this skill's changes, with safety check

If `README.md` appears in `readme_pre_dirty_paths` (the user already had unstaged changes there before the skill ran), abort the commit:

> "`README.md` had uncommitted changes before the skill ran. The skill won't mix its edits with yours. Commit or stash your changes manually, then re-run, or commit the skill's work yourself."

Otherwise:

```bash
git add README.md
```

Use `AskUserQuestion`:

> "Commit the README change?"

Options:
1. `"Commit with this message"` (show the message; recommended)
2. `"Edit the message"` — ask the user for replacement text via a follow-up `AskUserQuestion` free-text prompt
3. `"Skip — I'll commit myself"`

If the user skips, leave the file staged and jump to the summary.

If the user commits, run:

```bash
git commit -m "$COMMIT_MESSAGE"
```

(Use a heredoc to preserve the body line.)

### 6c — Push and PR

| `branch_state` | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| `existing-branch` | No push, no PR. Print: "Committed to `$CURRENT_BRANCH`. Push when you're ready." |
| `default-branch` | `AskUserQuestion`: "Push to `origin/$DEFAULT_BRANCH`?" Options: `"Yes, push"`, `"No, I'll push later"`. If yes: `git push`. |
| `new-branch` | `AskUserQuestion`: "Push and open a PR?" Options: `"Push and open a PR"`, `"Push only"`, `"Neither — I'll handle it"`. If push+PR: `git push -u origin "$CURRENT_BRANCH" && gh pr create --fill`. If push only: `git push -u origin "$CURRENT_BRANCH"`. |

For all push paths use plain `git push` (no `--force`, no `--force-with-lease`). If push fails, surface the error and stop without retrying.

If `gh pr create` fails after a successful push, print the error and a hint:

> "PR creation failed. Branch is pushed; open the PR manually at https://github.com/$OWNER_REPO/pull/new/$CURRENT_BRANCH"

## Final summary

Print a structured summary listing:

- Each EC requirement and whether it's now satisfied (with `[OK]` or `[FIX]` markers).
- Any actions still pending (e.g., "review and merge the PR", "submit to the Electric Capital `crypto-ecosystems` repo manually").
- A link to the EC submission process if the user wants to take the next step:
  > "To submit your project to the Electric Capital report, follow the instructions at https://github.com/electric-capital/crypto-ecosystems"

## Idempotency

Re-running the skill on a fully eligible project must:

1. Pass Phase 1.
2. Pass Phase 2 (no changes).
3. Skip the branch question — go straight through Phase 3 (no edits to make).
4. Phase 4: print `[OK]` for both topics, no `gh repo edit` calls.
5. Phase 5: detect the existing sentence, print `[OK]`, skip Phase 6.
6. Print the "already eligible" summary.

No prompts, no edits, no commits.

## Reference files

- `references/ec-criteria.md` — the canonical Electric Capital requirements and the three verbatim attribution sentences. Use this as the source of truth — never paraphrase.
- `references/project-categorisation.md` — what each detection signal means and how the category is recommended.
- `references/readme-placement.md` — the placement heuristic with worked examples.

## Verifying the helper scripts

The three helper scripts each have a fixture-based test driver. Run them all from the skill directory:

```bash
bash "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/test-detect-project.sh"
bash "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/test-check-readme.sh"
bash "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/test-detect-commit-convention.sh"
```

Each prints `N passed, 0 failed` on success.
