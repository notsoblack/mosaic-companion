# Proof Server Architecture

The Midnight proof server is a Rust service built on actix-web v4 that generates zero-knowledge proofs for Midnight transactions. The binary is named `midnight-proof-server`. For basic Docker setup, health checks, and running the proof server, see `midnight-tooling:proof-server`. This skill covers internal architecture, component design, and the proving pipeline.

## Core Components

```text
midnight-proof-server binary
├── main.rs          CLI parsing, startup orchestration
├── lib.rs           HTTP server setup (actix-web v4)
├── endpoints.rs     Request handlers for all API routes
├── worker_pool.rs   Async channel-based job queue
└── versioned_ir.rs  ZKIR IR-format dispatch (zkir_v2 / zkir_v3)
```

### Component Responsibilities

| Component | Role |
|-----------|------|
| `main.rs` | Parses CLI flags and env vars, initializes key material, launches HTTP server |
| `lib.rs` | Configures actix-web server, sets up routes, manages app state |
| `endpoints.rs` | Implements all HTTP endpoint handlers (`/prove`, `/check`, `/k`, etc.) |
| `worker_pool.rs` | Manages async job queue with configurable parallelism and capacity |
| `versioned_ir.rs` | Dispatches proving requests on the ZKIR IR format (`zkir_v2` / `zkir_v3`) to the correct handler |

## Worker Pool Architecture

The worker pool uses an async channel-based job queue to manage proof generation concurrently.

```text
HTTP Request ──→ endpoints.rs ──→ Worker Pool Channel
                                       │
                                       ▼
                              ┌──────────────────┐
                              │   Job Queue       │
                              │  (async channel)  │
                              └──────┬───────────┘
                                     │
                          ┌──────────┼──────────┐
                          ▼          ▼          ▼
                      Worker 1   Worker 2   Worker N
                  (spawn_blocking, per-job current-thread rt)
```

### Configuration

| Parameter | Default | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `--num-workers` | 2 | Number of parallel proving threads |
| `--job-capacity` | 0 (unlimited) | Max pending jobs in queue |
| `--job-timeout` | 600.0s (10 min) | TTL for each job before garbage collection |

### Job Lifecycle

Every proving request follows this state machine:

```text
Pending ──→ Processing ──→ Success
                       └──→ Error
                       └──→ Cancelled (timeout/GC)
```

1. **Pending** -- Job is submitted to the channel and waits for an available worker
2. **Processing** -- A worker picks up the job and offloads it via `spawn_blocking`; inside the blocking closure a fresh current-thread tokio runtime is built for that single job, and proof generation begins
3. **Success** -- Proof generated and returned to the caller
4. **Error** -- Proving failed (invalid input, internal error)
5. **Cancelled** -- Job exceeded its TTL and was removed by garbage collection

### Capacity Limiting

When `--job-capacity` is set to a non-zero value, the worker pool enforces a maximum queue depth. If the queue is full when a new `/prove` request arrives, the server returns HTTP 429 (Too Many Requests). This prevents unbounded memory growth under heavy load.

### Garbage Collection

A background task runs every 10 seconds and removes jobs that have exceeded their TTL (`--job-timeout`). Workers run on the shared tokio runtime and offload each CPU-intensive proof job via `spawn_blocking`; a fresh current-thread tokio runtime is built per job inside the blocking closure. This isolation prevents a slow proof from starving the HTTP server's event loop.

## Proving Pipeline

A proving request travels from a deserialized `ProofPreimageVersioned` through an optional `/check` call (branch-omission and zero-padding resolution) and then through `/prove`, which resolves the proving key via the `Resolver` chain, selects the matching public-parameter set keyed on the circuit's `k`, and returns `ProofVersioned::V2(proof)`. The `versioned_ir.rs` module dispatches on the ZKIR IR format (`zkir_v2` vs `zkir_v3`) — this is independent of the proof-version enum, which is a binary-serialization concept with only a `V2` variant. See `references/proving-pipeline.md` for the full flow diagram, `check` semantics, and resolver composition detail.

## Key Material Management

On startup, the proof server pre-fetches cryptographic material required for proof generation. Key material is managed by a `PUBLIC_PARAMS` / `MidnightDataProvider(FetchMode::OnDemand)` / `DustResolver` stack: the four built-in circuit proving keys and public parameters for `k = 10..=15` are fetched before the server accepts requests; application-specific proving keys for custom Compact contracts are resolved on first use. See `references/key-material.md` for the full resolver composition diagram, on-demand resolution flow, and the `k` ↔ public-parameters relationship.

### Public Parameters

Pre-fetches public parameters for k values 10 through 15. These parameters define the polynomial commitment scheme size and are shared across all circuits with the same k value.

### Proving Keys

Pre-fetches proving keys for 4 built-in circuits:

| Circuit | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `midnight/zswap/spend` | Spending a shielded coin (nullifier creation) |
| `midnight/zswap/output` | Creating a shielded coin (commitment creation) |
| `midnight/zswap/sign` | Schnorr signature proof for transaction binding |
| `midnight/dust/spend` | Spending native DUST tokens |

### Data Provider

Uses `MidnightDataProvider` with `FetchMode::OnDemand` to manage key material. On-demand mode means any keys not pre-fetched at startup are fetched on first use (application-specific proving keys for custom Compact contracts).

### Startup Behavior

Pre-fetching parameters and keys can take several minutes depending on network speed and cache state. Use `--no-fetch-params` to skip pre-fetching for faster startup, but the first proof request for each circuit will incur the fetch latency.

## ZKIR Versioning

The proof-version enums (`ProofVersioned` / `ProofPreimageVersioned`) have a single `V2` variant -- there is no V2/V3 proof-version enum. "V3" refers to the separate experimental `zkir-v3` crate, which is an optional dependency gated behind the proof server's `experimental` Cargo feature (default off, not enabled in standard builds).

| ZKIR IR format | Status | Notes |
|----------------|--------|-------|
| `zkir_v2` | Default | Production-ready, used by current Compact compiler output |
| `zkir_v3` | Experimental | Provided by the optional `zkir-v3` crate behind the `experimental` Cargo feature (default off) |

The `versioned_ir.rs` module dispatches proving requests on the ZKIR IR format (`zkir_v2` vs `zkir_v3`), not on a proof-version enum. The `/proof-versions` endpoint reports which proof versions the running server supports (typically `["V2"]`).

## Binary Serialization

All proving endpoints (`/prove`, `/prove-tx`, `/check`, `/k`) use a custom tagged binary serialization format -- not JSON. This format is defined by the `midnight-serialize` crate and is the same format used by the Midnight node and wallet SDK for proof-related data.

The binary format provides:
- Compact encoding for large cryptographic structures
- Tagged fields for forward compatibility
- Efficient deserialization without schema negotiation

Health and metadata endpoints (`/health`, `/ready`, `/version`, `/proof-versions`) use JSON or plain text.

## Key Dependencies

| Crate | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `midnight-ledger` (proving feature) | Core proving logic and circuit execution |
| `midnight-zswap` | Shielded token proof generation (spend/output/sign) |
| `midnight-zkir` | ZKIR parsing and version handling |
| `midnight-base-crypto` | Cryptographic primitives (field elements, curves) |
| `midnight-transient-crypto` | Transient hash and commitment functions |
| `midnight-serialize` | Binary serialization/deserialization |

The workspace version is **<version>**. Version numbers reflect the release at time of writing and may have been superseded. Replace `<version>` with the version matching your target Midnight network. Check `midnight-tooling:release-notes` for current versions.

## Docker / OCI Image

The proof server Docker image is built with a multi-stage process:

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Build system | Nix flakes |
| Binary linking | Statically linked (musl) |
| Base image | Minimal (bash + coreutils + CA certificates) |
| Architectures | `amd64`, `arm64` (multi-arch manifest) |
| Registries | GHCR (`ghcr.io/midnight-ntwrk/proof-server`, hyphenated), Docker Hub (`midnightntwrk/proof-server`) -- both multi-arch (`amd64`/`arm64`) |

The static musl build ensures the binary runs without any shared library dependencies, making the image portable across Linux distributions. The minimal base image reduces attack surface and image size.
