# Compact Ledger & On-Chain State

This skill covers everything about on-chain state in Compact: declaring ledger fields, choosing and using ADT types, initializing state in constructors, designing state for privacy, and understanding what is visible on-chain. It does not cover general language mechanics (types, operators, control flow) -- those belong in `compact-language-ref`. It does not cover overall contract anatomy or circuit/witness design -- those belong in `compact-structure`.

## Ledger Declaration Quick Reference

Each ledger field is declared individually with optional modifiers:

```compact
export ledger publicField: Counter;          // Public, mutable
ledger privateField: Field;                  // Internal, mutable
export sealed ledger immutable: Bytes<32>;   // Public, set once in constructor
sealed ledger secret: Field;                 // Internal, set once in constructor
```

| Modifier | Effect |
|----------|--------|
| `export` | Readable from TypeScript DApp code |
| `sealed` | Can only be set during constructor (directly or via helper circuits called by constructor) |
| `export sealed` | Both: publicly readable and immutable after deployment |

Valid ledger types: any Compact type (`Field`, `Boolean`, `Bytes<N>`, `Uint<N>`, enums, structs), `Counter`, `Map<K, V>`, `Set<T>`, `List<T>`, `MerkleTree<N, T>`, `HistoricMerkleTree<N, T>`, and nested ADTs like `Map<K, Map<K2, V>>`. **Note:** Nested ADTs are only permitted as `Map` values — e.g., `Map<K, Set<T>>` or `Map<K, List<T>>` are valid, but `Set<Map<K,V>>`, `List<Map<K,V>>`, etc. are invalid.

For exhaustive syntax rules and modifier details, see `references/types-and-operations.md`.

## ADT Types Overview

| Type | Purpose | Key Operations | Privacy |
|------|---------|---------------|---------|
| `Counter` | Numeric counter | `increment`, `decrement`, `read`, `lessThan` | All ops visible |
| `Map<K, V>` | Key-value store | `insert`, `lookup`, `member`, `remove` | All ops visible |
| `Set<T>` | Unique elements | `insert`, `member`, `remove` | All ops visible |
| `List<T>` | Ordered sequence | `pushFront`, `popFront`, `head` | All ops visible |
| `MerkleTree<N, T>` | Privacy-preserving set | `insert`, `checkRoot` | **Insert hides leaf** (via `leaf_hash()`); **privacy via membership proofs** |
| `HistoricMerkleTree<N, T>` | MerkleTree with root history | Same + `resetHistory` | **Insert hides leaf** (via `leaf_hash()`); **privacy via membership proofs** |

For complete operations tables with parameters, return types, and edge cases, see `references/types-and-operations.md`.

## State Design Decision Tree

| Need | Recommended Type | Why |
|------|-----------------|-----|
| Track a count (supply, rounds) | `Counter` | Built-in increment/decrement with `Uint<16>` steps |
| Store key-value pairs | `Map<K, V>` | Direct lookup by key |
| Track membership (allowlists) | `Set<T>` | Membership checks, but reveals which element |
| Private membership proofs | `MerkleTree<N, T>` | Hides which element's membership is proven |
| Ordered log / queue | `List<T>` | Front-insertion and front-removal |
| Private membership + late proofs | `HistoricMerkleTree<N, T>` | Accepts proofs against past roots |
| Single immutable value | `sealed ledger x: T` | Constructor-only assignment |
| Store a numeric value directly | `ledger x: Uint<64>` | Direct assignment, no ADT needed |

For the complete decision matrix with trade-offs, nested ADT strategies, and worked examples, see `references/state-design.md`.

## Constructor Initialization

The constructor runs once at deployment. Use it to initialize sealed fields and set initial state:

```compact
export sealed ledger owner: Bytes<32>;
export ledger phase: Phase;
export ledger count: Counter;

witness local_secret_key(): Bytes<32>;

constructor() {
  owner = disclose(persistentHash<Vector<2, Bytes<32>>>([pad(32, "myapp:pk:"), local_secret_key()]));
  phase = Phase.registration;
  // count starts at 0 by default — no initialization needed
}
```

Key rules:
- At most one constructor per contract
- `sealed` fields can only be set in the constructor or helper circuits called by the constructor
- It is a static error if a sealed field is settable from an exported circuit
- ADT fields use their methods (e.g., `count.increment(n)`), not direct assignment
- Witness calls are allowed in constructors

For constructor patterns, pitfalls, and multi-field initialization strategies, see `references/state-design.md`.

## On-Chain Visibility Summary

All ledger operations are publicly visible on-chain, **except** `MerkleTree.insert()` which hides the leaf value -- the compiler applies `leaf_hash()` (a `persistent_hash`) before storing, so only the hash appears in the transaction transcript. This is the only ledger operation that hides its data argument.
The additional privacy benefit of MerkleTree is in **membership proofs** -- ZK path proofs do not reveal which specific leaf is being proven.

| Operation Type | Visible On-Chain |
|---------------|-----------------|
| Direct field read/write | Yes -- value visible |
| Counter increment/decrement | Yes -- amount visible |
| Map insert/lookup/member/remove | Yes -- key and value visible |
| Set insert/member/remove | Yes -- element visible |
| List pushFront/popFront | Yes -- element visible |
| MerkleTree insert | **No** -- the compiler applies `leaf_hash()` (a `persistent_hash`) before storing; only the hash is in the transaction transcript. This is the only ledger operation that hides its data argument. |
| MerkleTree checkRoot | Yes -- digest visible |

For detailed per-operation visibility analysis, MerkleTree vs Set privacy comparison, disclosure rules, and privacy design patterns, see `references/privacy-and-visibility.md`.

## Kernel Ledger

The `Kernel` type provides access to contract metadata and token operations:

The `kernel` field is predefined by `import CompactStandardLibrary;` — do not declare it manually. Use it directly:

```compact
export circuit getSelf(): ContractAddress {
  return kernel.self();
}
```

| Method | Returns | Purpose |
|--------|---------|---------|
| `self()` | `ContractAddress` | Get the contract's own address |
| `checkpoint()` | `[]` | Create a transaction checkpoint |
| `mintShielded(domainSep, amount)` | `[]` | Mint shielded tokens |
| `mintUnshielded(domainSep, amount)` | `[]` | Mint unshielded tokens |

For the full Kernel API including zswap claim operations, see `references/types-and-operations.md`.

## Common Mistakes

| Wrong | Correct | Why |
|-------|---------|-----|
| `ledger { field: Type; }` | `export ledger field: Type;` | Block syntax was removed in Compact 0.10.1 — causes a parse error |
| `counter.value()` | `counter.read()` | `.value()` does not exist |
| `map.lookup(key)` without member check | Check `map.member(key)` first | `lookup` on missing key throws a runtime error (ExpectedCell) |
| `sealed ledger export x: T` | `export sealed ledger x: T` | `export` must come before `sealed` |
| Direct assignment to ADT | Use ADT methods | `count = 5` is wrong; use `count.increment(5)` |
| `MerkleTree<1, T>` | `MerkleTree<2, T>` minimum | Depth must be > 1 and <= 32 |
| Forgetting `disclose()` on ledger write | `field = disclose(value)` | Witness-derived values need disclosure |
