description: Use this skill when an agent needs real, compilable examples of Compact smart contracts, TypeScript witnesses, or tests. Covers beginner contracts (counter, bulletin board), reusable modules (access control, security, tokens, math, crypto, data structures, identity, utils), composed token contracts (fungible, NFT, multi-token, shielded), and full applications (CryptoKitties, ZK lending, real-world assets). All examples compile with pragma language_version >= 0.22 and full proof generation.

# Compact Code Examples

Compilable Compact smart contracts, TypeScript witnesses, and tests sourced from 8 repositories. All code uses `pragma language_version >= 0.22` and passes `compact compile` with full proof generation.

## How to use this skill

1. Find your topic in the routing table below
2. Read the reference file — it catalogues every example with file paths and descriptions
3. Read only the specific `.compact` and witness files you need

Do NOT load all examples into context. Use the reference files to pick precisely what you need.

## Routing Table

| Topic | Reference | When to use |
|---|---|---|
| Beginner examples | references/getting-started.md | Simple contracts, learning basics, minimal state management |
| Reusable modules | references/modules.md | Access control, math, crypto, data structures, utils — building blocks you import |
| Token contracts | references/tokens.md | Fungible, NFT, multi-token, shielded tokens — complete deployable contracts |
| Privacy & cryptography | references/privacy-and-cryptography.md | ZK patterns, signatures, identity proofs, privacy techniques |
| Full applications | references/applications.md | Multi-module DApps, real-world architecture, how pieces compose |
