# Indexer Operations

Operational guide for running, health-checking, monitoring, and troubleshooting the Midnight indexer. For starting and stopping the local Docker stack, see `midnight-tooling:devnet`. For the full observability and troubleshooting reference, see `references/monitoring-and-troubleshooting.md` in this skill.

## Deployment Recap

The indexer ships in two deployment shapes. For full detail see `midnight-indexer:indexer-architecture` → `references/deployment-and-crates.md`.

| Shape | Services | Storage | Bus |
|-------|----------|---------|-----|
| Standalone | Single binary (`indexer-standalone`) | SQLite | In-process |
| Cloud | 4 services: `chain-indexer`, `wallet-indexer`, `indexer-api`, `spo-indexer` | PostgreSQL | NATS |

**Default port:** 8088 (GraphQL + health probes on the same listener).

## Health Checks

The indexer exposes two HTTP probes on the GraphQL port (default **8088**). Both are served by the same Axum router as the GraphQL endpoint.

| Endpoint | Kubernetes role | Returns |
|----------|----------------|---------|
| `GET /live` | Liveness | `200 OK` — always, as long as the async runtime is responsive |
| `GET /ready` | Readiness | `200 OK` when caught up with the node; `503 Service Unavailable` with body `"indexer has not yet caught up with the node"` otherwise |

Source: `indexer-api/src/infra/api.rs:277–309`.

```bash
# Liveness — is the process alive?
curl -sf http://localhost:8088/live

# Readiness — has it caught up with the node?
curl -o - -w "\nHTTP %{http_code}\n" http://localhost:8088/ready
```

The `/live` handler runs in the async task executor; if a storage-layer deadlock parks the runtime, the liveness probe times out rather than returning 200, which lets Kubernetes terminate and recreate the pod.

### Docker / Kubernetes Patterns

The official Docker **Compose** stack defines a `HEALTHCHECK` for each service that tests a running-file: the entrypoint creates `/var/run/<component>/running` on startup and removes it on exit (via `trap … EXIT`), and the healthcheck command is `cat /var/run/<component>/running`. The image Dockerfiles themselves embed no `HEALTHCHECK`. For Kubernetes — or to gate traffic on actual readiness rather than liveness — prefer the HTTP probes:

```yaml
# Kubernetes
livenessProbe:
  httpGet:
    path: /live
    port: 8088
  initialDelaySeconds: 15
  periodSeconds: 30
readinessProbe:
  httpGet:
    path: /ready
    port: 8088
  initialDelaySeconds: 30
  periodSeconds: 10
```

```yaml
# Docker Compose
healthcheck:
  test: ["CMD", "curl", "-sf", "http://localhost:8088/ready"]
  interval: 30s
  timeout: 5s
  retries: 3
  start_period: 60s
```

## Caught-Up Status

"Caught up" governs whether `/ready` returns 200 and whether the `indexer_caught_up` gauge is 1.

| Config key | Default | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| `caught_up_max_distance` | `10` | Max blocks behind the node before `caught_up = false` |
| `caught_up_leeway` | `5` | Hysteresis — must catch within this distance before `caught_up` flips back to `true` |

The formula: `caught_up = (node_height − indexed_height) ≤ caught_up_max_distance`, with `caught_up_leeway` preventing rapid oscillation at the threshold. A 503 from `/ready` during initial sync is **normal and expected** — the indexer must process all historical blocks before it reports ready.

Configuration keys live under `APP__` in environment or in `config.yaml`. See `midnight-indexer:indexer-architecture` → `references/configuration-reference.md` for the full key listing.

## Metrics and Tracing

Both are **disabled by default** in standalone and cloud deployments. Enable them via environment variables or `config.yaml`.

### Prometheus Metrics

```bash
# Enable via environment
APP__TELEMETRY__METRICS__ENABLED=true   # required
APP__TELEMETRY__METRICS__ADDRESS=0.0.0.0
APP__TELEMETRY__METRICS__PORT=9000      # default
```

Scrape endpoint: `http://<host>:9000/metrics`

| Metric | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `indexer_block_height` | counter | Highest block the indexer has processed |
| `indexer_node_block_height` | counter | Latest block height reported by the node |
| `indexer_caught_up` | gauge | 1 = caught up, 0 = behind |
| `indexer_transaction_count` | counter | Total transactions indexed |
| `indexer_wallets_connected` | gauge | Active wallet sessions |
| `indexer_subscriptions_active` | gauge | Active GraphQL subscriptions |
| `indexer_subscriptions_rejected_total` | counter | Subscriptions rejected by quota |

For the full metric catalog and example Grafana queries, see `references/monitoring-and-troubleshooting.md`.

### OpenTelemetry Tracing

```bash
APP__TELEMETRY__TRACING__ENABLED=true
APP__TELEMETRY__TRACING__OTLP_EXPORTER_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:4317  # default
APP__TELEMETRY__TRACING__SERVICE_NAME=indexer
```

Spans are exported via gRPC OTLP to the configured endpoint. Logs are correlated with traces — when a log record is emitted inside a span, the trace ID is included in the JSON log output.

## Node Connection and Recovery

The indexer connects to the Midnight node via subxt with a built-in reconnecting RPC client using exponential backoff.

| Config key | Default | Notes |
|-----------|---------|-------|
| `reconnect_max_delay` | `10s` | Backoff ceiling; steps are 10ms → 100ms → 1s → 10s |
| `reconnect_max_attempts` | `30` | ≈ 5 minutes of retries before the process exits |
| `subscription_recovery_timeout` | `30s` | If no valid block arrives after a reconnect or duplicate event within this window, the subscription is torn down and re-established |

When the node disconnects, a `WARN` log line `"node disconnected, reconnecting"` is emitted. After `reconnect_max_attempts` failures the process exits so the container orchestrator can restart it.

Config keys live under `APP__INFRA__NODE__` (the standalone binary also has a separate `APP__INFRA__SPO_NODE__` for its Cardano-side connection). See `midnight-indexer:indexer-architecture` → `references/configuration-reference.md`.

## Wallet Session Lifecycle

Wallet sessions let the indexer scan shielded transactions for a specific viewing key without exposing that key on-chain.

```text
connect(viewingKey)
  → viewing key encrypted at rest (ChaCha20-Poly1305, key from APP__INFRA__SECRET)
  → wallet-indexer scans blocks for relevant transactions
  → client subscribes via shieldedTransactions(sessionId)

disconnect(sessionId)
  → session ends, resources released
```

| Config key | Default | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| `active_wallets_ttl` | `30m` | Idle sessions are evicted after this duration |
| `keep_wallet_alive_interval` | `1m` | Heartbeat interval to keep long-running catch-up sessions alive |

`APP__INFRA__SECRET` must be set to a hex-encoded 32-byte key before the indexer will accept `connect` mutations. Missing or invalid `SECRET` causes startup failure or decryption errors at session creation time.

For the GraphQL mutations (`connect`, `disconnect`) and the `shieldedTransactions` subscription, see `midnight-indexer:indexer-graphql-api`.

## NATS Failure Handling (Cloud)

In cloud mode, `chain-indexer` → `wallet-indexer` and `chain-indexer` → `indexer-api` communication flows through NATS (core pub-sub — the server runs with `-js` but the indexer creates no JetStream streams or consumers). Publisher and subscriber components log `WARN` on `Event::ServerError` and `Event::ClientError` from the NATS client library; a startup `ConnectError` causes the service to exit so the orchestrator can retry.

For subjects, consumer groups, and failure modes, see `midnight-indexer:indexer-architecture` → `references/nats-messaging.md`.

## Troubleshooting

Quick-reference for common failure modes. Full diagnostic procedures and log patterns are in `references/monitoring-and-troubleshooting.md`.

| Symptom | Likely cause | First action |
|---------|-------------|--------------|
| `/ready` returns 503 continuously | Initial sync not complete, or node unreachable | Check `indexer_block_height` vs `indexer_node_block_height`; confirm node is reachable |
| `indexer_caught_up` stuck at 0 | Block processing stalled or node connection lost | Check logs for `"node disconnected"` or DB errors |
| `connect` mutation fails | `APP__INFRA__SECRET` missing or malformed | Verify the env var is set to a valid 64-char hex string |
| NATS startup failure (cloud) | NATS server not reachable at startup | Check `APP__INFRA__PUB_SUB__URL`; verify NATS container is healthy |
| DB migration errors | Schema version mismatch after upgrade | Check logs for `sqlx` migration errors; ensure the DB is accessible |
| Wallet sessions evicted unexpectedly | `active_wallets_ttl` too short for catch-up duration | Increase `active_wallets_ttl` or ensure the client heartbeats within the TTL |
| Blockfrost 402 errors (SPO indexer) | Blockfrost plan limit reached or invalid `BLOCKFROST_ID` | Verify `APP__INFRA__SPO_NODE__BLOCKFROST_ID` and plan quota |

```bash
# Diagnostic checklist
# 1. Is the process alive?
curl -sf http://localhost:8088/live && echo "LIVE"

# 2. Has it caught up with the node?
curl -o - -w "\nHTTP %{http_code}\n" http://localhost:8088/ready

# 3. What metrics show?
curl -s http://localhost:9000/metrics | grep -E "indexer_(block_height|node_block_height|caught_up)"

# 4. Recent log output (standalone Docker)
docker logs --tail 50 indexer-standalone

# 5. Follow logs in real time
docker logs -f indexer-standalone
```
