  This skill should be used when the user asks about the Midnight Wallet SDK
  packages (@midnight-ntwrk/wallet-sdk-*), how to construct a wallet with
  WalletFacade, HD key derivation from seeds or mnemonics,
  the three-wallet architecture (shielded, unshielded, dust), observing wallet
  state and sync progress, transaction balancing and signing, proving and
  submission services, connecting to infrastructure (indexer client, node client,
  prover client), or Bech32m address formatting. Also covers ProtocolVersion,
  SyncProgress, FacadeState, and the wallet runtime

# Wallet SDK Reference

Reference for the `@midnight-ntwrk/wallet-sdk-*` packages.

## Critical caveat — verify SDK is current

Patterns in this skill were verified against the package versions pinned
in `midnight-wallet:sdk-regression-check/versions.lock.json`. The
Midnight Network ecosystem moves quickly, and there may be breaking
changes between SDK versions. Run `midnight-wallet:sdk-regression-check`
before trusting any pattern here.

## Scope — browser wallets are out of scope

This skill is the package-level reference for the wallet SDK
(`@midnight-ntwrk/wallet-sdk-*`), used in programmatic contexts where
the script owns the keys directly. If the user is integrating their
DApp with a browser extension wallet (Lace or other), load
`midnight-dapp-dev:dapp-connector` instead.

## Quick Start: Wallet Construction

The most common task is constructing a `WalletFacade` from a seed. The flow is:

    Seed (64 hex chars)
      → HDWallet.fromSeed() → selectAccount(0) → selectRoles() → deriveKeysAt(0)
        → ShieldedWallet (Zswap role)
        → UnshieldedWallet (NightExternal role)
        → DustWallet (Dust role)
          → WalletFacade.init({ shielded, unshielded, dust, configuration })

Key packages involved:

| Package | What it provides |
|---------|-----------------|
| `@midnight-ntwrk/wallet-sdk-hd` | `HDWallet`, `Roles`, `generateRandomSeed` |
| `@midnight-ntwrk/wallet-sdk-facade` | `WalletFacade` — unified API |
| `@midnight-ntwrk/wallet-sdk-shielded` | `ShieldedWallet` factory |
| `@midnight-ntwrk/wallet-sdk-unshielded-wallet` | `UnshieldedWallet` factory, `createKeystore`, `PublicKey` |
| `@midnight-ntwrk/wallet-sdk-dust-wallet` | `DustWallet` factory |

For the full construction code, see `examples/basic-wallet-setup.ts`.
For configuration details, see `references/wallet-construction.md`.
