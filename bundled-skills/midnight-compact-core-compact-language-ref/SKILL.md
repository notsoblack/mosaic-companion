# Compact Language Reference

This skill covers Compact language mechanics: the type system, operators, expressions, type casting, control flow, the module system, and the standard library. It does not cover contract architecture (ledger declarations, circuit design, witness integration, constructor layout) -- those belong in `compact-structure`. Use this skill when you need to know how the language works rather than how to structure a contract.

## Types Quick Reference

Compact is statically and strongly typed. Every expression has a type known at compile time.

| Category | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| **Primitive** | `Field` | Scalar field element; unbounded within the field prime |
| **Primitive** | `Boolean` | `true` or `false` |
| **Primitive** | `Bytes<N>` | Fixed-size byte array of N bytes |
| **Primitive** | `Uint<N>` | N-bit unsigned integer; values 0 to 2^N - 1 |
| **Primitive** | `Uint<0..MAX>` | Bounded unsigned integer; 0 to MAX inclusive; `Uint<8>` = `Uint<0..255>` |
| **Opaque** | `Opaque<"string">` | Hashed in circuits, full string in witnesses and TypeScript |
| **Opaque** | `Opaque<"Uint8Array">` | Hashed in circuits, `Uint8Array` in witnesses and TypeScript |
| **Collection** | `Vector<N, T>` | Fixed-size array of N elements; shorthand for `[T, T, ..., T]` |
| **Collection** | `Maybe<T>` | Optional; `some<T>(v)` / `none<T>()`; inspect `.is_some`, `.value` |
| **Collection** | `Either<L, R>` | Sum type; `left<L,R>(v)` / `right<L,R>(v)`; inspect `.is_left`, `.left`, `.right` |
| **Custom** | `enum` | Named variants; dot notation (`State.active`); export for TypeScript |
| **Custom** | `struct` | Named fields; named, positional, and spread construction |
| **Custom** | Tuples `[T, ...]` | Heterogeneous fixed-size sequences; `[]` is the unit type |

Numeric literals have tight bounded types: `42` has type `Uint<0..42>`. Subtyping allows implicit widening -- `Uint<0..42>` fits wherever `Uint<64>` is expected. All `Uint` types are subtypes of `Field`.

For full type documentation, default values, subtyping rules, and TypeScript representations, see `references/types-and-values.md`.

## Operators

### Arithmetic Operators

Compact provides three arithmetic operators. Division and modulo do not exist in the language.

| Operator | Name | Uint Result Type | Notes |
|----------|------|-----------------|-------|
| `+` | Add | `Uint<0..m+n>` | Result widens; cast back before assignment |
| `-` | Subtract | `Uint<0..m>` | Runtime error if result would be negative |
| `*` | Multiply | `Uint<0..m*n>` | Result widens; cast back before assignment |

When either operand is `Field`, the result is `Field` and wraps modulo the field prime. Cast `Uint` to `Field` explicitly only if you want to force field arithmetic semantics. Because arithmetic widens result types, cast before assigning: `balance = (balance + amount) as Uint<64>;`.

### Comparison Operators

| Operator | Name | Operand Requirement |
|----------|------|-------------------|
| `==` | Equal | Any two values with types in a subtype relation |
| `!=` | Not equal | Any two values with types in a subtype relation |
| `<` | Less than | Both operands must be `Uint` (not `Field`) |
| `<=` | Less or equal | Both operands must be `Uint` (not `Field`) |
| `>` | Greater than | Both operands must be `Uint` (not `Field`) |
| `>=` | Greater or equal | Both operands must be `Uint` (not `Field`) |

Relational operators do not work on `Field`. Cast to `Uint` first: `(f as Uint<64>) > 0`.

### Boolean Operators

| Operator | Name | Behavior |
|----------|------|----------|
| `&&` | Logical AND | Short-circuit; evaluates right only if left is `true` |
| `\|\|` | Logical OR | Short-circuit; evaluates right only if left is `false` |
| `!` | Negation | Unary prefix; flips `true` to `false` and vice versa |

All operands must have type `Boolean`.

For full details on operator type rules, conditional expressions, literal typing, and anonymous circuits (lambdas), see `references/operators-and-expressions.md`.

## Type Casting Quick Reference

Compact uses the `as` keyword for casts. TypeScript-style angle-bracket casts are not supported.

### Direct Casts

| From | To | Kind | Example |
|------|----|------|---------|
| `Uint<0..m>` | `Field` | Static (always safe) | `myUint as Field` |
| `Uint<0..m>` | `Uint<0..n>` (m <= n) | Static (widening) | `small as Uint<64>` |
| `Uint<0..m>` | `Uint<0..n>` (m > n) | Checked (runtime) | `big as Uint<8>` |
| `Field` | `Uint<0..n>` | Checked (runtime) | `f as Uint<64>` |
| `Field` | `Boolean` | Conversion | `f as Boolean` (0 -> false, else true) |
| `Field` | `Bytes<N>` | Conversion (checked) | `f as Bytes<32>` |
| `Boolean` | `Uint<0..n>` | Conversion | `flag as Uint<0..1>` (false -> 0, true -> 1). Checked when n=0 (fails at runtime if true) |
| `Boolean` | `Field` | Conversion | `flag as Field` (false -> 0, true -> 1) |
| `Uint<0..m>` | `Boolean` | Conversion | `myUint as Boolean` (0 -> false, non-zero -> true) |
| `Bytes<N>` | `Field` | Conversion (checked) | `b as Field` |
| `enum` | `Field` | Conversion | `Choice.rock as Field` (variant index) |

### Optional Multi-Step Casts

| From | To | Direct | Via Field |
|------|----|--------|-----------|
| `Uint<N>` | `Bytes<M>` | `amount as Bytes<32>` | `(amount as Field) as Bytes<32>` |

Both routes compile and produce the same result. The `Field` intermediate step is optional.

For the complete cast path table, see `references/operators-and-expressions.md`.

## Control Flow

### Variable Declarations

All local bindings use `const`. No `let`, `var`, or reassignment. Multiple bindings in one statement: `const x = 1, y = x + 1;`. Destructuring works for tuples (`const [a, b] = pair;`) and structs (`const { x, y } = point;`).

### Conditional Branching

Standard `if`/`else` with `Boolean` condition. No `else if` keyword -- use nested `if`/`else`. Ternary `c ? a : b` is also available. An `if` without `else` is allowed only when the circuit returns `[]`.

### For Loops

Two forms, both requiring compile-time-known bounds:

- **Range:** `for (const i of 0..5)` -- 0 inclusive to 5 exclusive
- **Vector/tuple:** `for (const v of values)` -- each element in order

The compiler unrolls every loop into flat circuit gates. `return` inside a loop body is rejected. Nested loops multiply gate count.

### What Does Not Exist

| Omitted | Reason | Alternative |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| `while` / `do-while` | Iteration count unknown at compile time | `for` with fixed range |
| Recursion | Unbounded call depth | Loops or repeated calls with fixed unrolling |
| `let` / `var` | Mutable state complicates circuit generation | `const` and shadowing |
| `switch` / `match` | Not part of the language | Nested `if`/`else` or ternary `c ? a : b` |
| `try` / `catch` | No exception model | `assert(condition, "message")` |
| `break` / `continue` | Every loop iteration must execute | `if` inside the loop body |

For full documentation on variable declarations, destructuring, shadowing, blocks, return statements, and loop restrictions, see `references/control-flow.md`.

## Module System

### Pragma

Every source file begins with a version pragma:

```compact
pragma language_version >= 0.22;
```

> **Tip:** Run `compact compile --language-version` to check which language version your compiler supports.

### Standard Library Import

`import CompactStandardLibrary;` brings all stdlib types (`Counter`, `Map`, `Set`, `MerkleTree`, `Maybe`, `Either`, `CoinInfo`) and utility functions into scope.

### Include

`include "path/to/file";` inserts contents verbatim. The compiler searches for `path/to/file.compact` in the current directory and `COMPACT_PATH` directories. No namespace isolation.

### Modules

Modules group definitions into namespaces. Identifiers are private unless exported. Modules can accept generic type parameters specialized at import time.

### Import Forms

| Form | Example | Effect |
|------|---------|--------|
| Standard library | `import CompactStandardLibrary;` | Brings all stdlib names into scope |
| Local module | `import Runner;` | Brings exported names from a local module into scope |
| Prefixed | `import Runner prefix Run_;` | All imported names get the `Run_` prefix |
| Selective | `import { test as t } from Test;` | Imports specific names with optional renaming |
| Generic | `import Identity<Field>;` | Specializes a generic module |
| Path-based | `import "utils/Auth";` | Imports from a file; file must contain a single module |

### Exports

Top-level `export` on circuits, types, and ledger fields defines the public API for TypeScript. Re-export stdlib types with `export { Maybe, Either };`.

For all import forms, generic modules, path resolution, and file organization patterns, see `references/modules-and-imports.md`.

## Standard Library Functions

All functions are available after `import CompactStandardLibrary;`.

### Hashing and Commitment Functions

| Function | Signature | Purpose |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| `persistentHash` | `persistentHash<T>(value: T): Bytes<32>` | SHA-256 based hash; stable across compiler upgrades; safe to store in ledger |
| `transientHash` | `transientHash<T>(value: T): Field` | Circuit-efficient hash; may change across upgrades; use only within one circuit |
| `persistentCommit` | `persistentCommit<T>(value: T, rand: Bytes<32>): Bytes<32>` | SHA-256 based commitment with randomness; stable; safe to store in ledger |
| `transientCommit` | `transientCommit<T>(value: T, rand: Field): Field` | Circuit-efficient commitment with randomness; use only within one circuit |

Use **persistent** variants when storing in ledger or comparing across transactions. Use **transient** variants for in-circuit intermediates where lower cost matters.

### Conversion Functions

| Function | Signature | Purpose |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| `degradeToTransient` | `degradeToTransient(x: Bytes<32>): Field` | Convert persistent-domain `Bytes<32>` to transient-domain `Field` |
| `upgradeFromTransient` | `upgradeFromTransient(x: Field): Bytes<32>` | Convert transient-domain `Field` back to persistent-domain `Bytes<32>` |

Use these when mixing persistent and transient operations in a single circuit.

### Utility Functions

| Function | Signature | Purpose |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| `pad` | `pad(length, value): Bytes<N>` | Create fixed-size `Bytes<N>` from a string literal; pads with zero bytes; both args must be literals |
| `disclose` | `disclose(value: T): T` | Mark a witness-derived value as publicly visible; required for ledger writes, cross-contract calls, and returns |
| `assert` | `assert(condition: Boolean, message: string): []` | Abort the transaction if condition is false; the only error-handling mechanism |
| `default` | `default<T>: T` | Return the default value for any type (false, 0, all-zero bytes, first enum variant, etc.); keyword expression, not a function call |

`disclose` is required whenever a witness-derived value is stored in the public ledger, returned from an exported circuit, or passed to another contract via a cross-contract call. Commitments protect their inputs and the commitment result from disclosure. No `disclose()` wrapper is needed, even when storing the commitment in the ledger.

For full documentation on each function including examples, disclosure rules, and persistent vs. transient guidance, see `references/stdlib-functions.md`.

## Troubleshooting Quick Reference

Common wrong-to-correct patterns:

| Wrong | Correct |
|-------|---------|
| `ledger { field: Type; }` | `export ledger field: Type;` |
| `circuit fn(): Void` | `circuit fn(): []` |
| `pragma >= 0.22.0` | `pragma language_version >= 0.22;` |
| `Choice::rock` | `Choice.rock` |
| `public_key(sk)` | `persistentHash<Vector<2, Bytes<32>>>([pad(32, "myapp:pk:"), sk])` |
| `counter.value()` | `counter.read()` |
| `if (witness_val == x)` | `if (disclose(witness_val == x))` |
| `witness fn(): T { body }` | `witness fn(): T;` (declaration only) |
