# Proof Server Configuration

Complete reference for all CLI flags and environment variables that control the Midnight proof server. For basic Docker setup and running, see `midnight-tooling:proof-server`. For internal architecture, see `proof-server:proof-server-architecture`.

> Replace `<version>` in image tags below with the version matching your target Midnight network. Check `midnight-tooling:release-notes` for current versions.

## CLI Flags & Environment Variables

Every CLI flag has a corresponding environment variable. When both are set, the CLI flag takes precedence.

| Flag | Env Var | Default | Description |
|------|---------|---------|-------------|
| `-p`, `--port` | `MIDNIGHT_PROOF_SERVER_PORT` | `6300` | HTTP listen port |
| `-v`, `--verbose` | `MIDNIGHT_PROOF_SERVER_VERBOSE` | `false` | Enable DEBUG-level logging |
| `--job-capacity` | `MIDNIGHT_PROOF_SERVER_JOB_CAPACITY` | `0` (unlimited) | Maximum number of pending jobs in the queue |
| `--num-workers` | `MIDNIGHT_PROOF_SERVER_NUM_WORKERS` | `2` | Number of parallel proving threads |
| `--job-timeout` | `MIDNIGHT_PROOF_SERVER_JOB_TIMEOUT` | `600.0` (10 min) | Job time-to-live in seconds before garbage collection |
| `--no-fetch-params` | `MIDNIGHT_PROOF_SERVER_NO_FETCH_PARAMS` | `false` | Skip pre-fetching ZK parameters and proving keys on startup |

## Flag Details

### `-p`, `--port`

The HTTP port the proof server listens on. Change this when running multiple proof server instances or when port 6300 conflicts with another service.

```bash
# CLI
midnight-proof-server --port 6301

# Environment variable
MIDNIGHT_PROOF_SERVER_PORT=6301 midnight-proof-server

# Docker
docker run -d --name midnight-proof-server -p 6301:6301 \
  midnightntwrk/proof-server:<version> -- midnight-proof-server --port 6301
```

When changing the port with Docker, update both the container port (`--port` flag inside the container) and the Docker port mapping (`-p` flag).

### `-v`, `--verbose`

Enables DEBUG-level logging output. Without this flag, only INFO and above are logged. Verbose mode is useful for diagnosing proving failures, timing issues, and key material fetching.

```bash
# CLI
midnight-proof-server -v

# Docker (recommended for development)
docker run -d --name midnight-proof-server -p 6300:6300 \
  midnightntwrk/proof-server:<version> -- midnight-proof-server -v
```

### `--num-workers`

Controls how many proof generation tasks can run in parallel. Workers run on the shared tokio runtime and offload each job via `spawn_blocking`; a fresh current-thread tokio runtime is created per job inside the blocking closure.

```bash
# CLI — 4 workers for a quad-core machine
midnight-proof-server --num-workers 4

# Environment variable
MIDNIGHT_PROOF_SERVER_NUM_WORKERS=4 midnight-proof-server

# Docker
docker run -d --name midnight-proof-server -p 6300:6300 \
  midnightntwrk/proof-server:<version> -- midnight-proof-server --num-workers 4
```

Worker count does not need to match CPU core count exactly. Proving is CPU-intensive, so more workers than cores leads to contention. Fewer workers than cores leaves headroom for the HTTP server and garbage collection.

### `--job-capacity`

Sets the maximum number of pending jobs in the worker pool queue. When the queue is full, new `/prove` requests receive HTTP 429 (Too Many Requests). A value of 0 (default) means unlimited queue depth.

```bash
# CLI — limit to 20 pending jobs
midnight-proof-server --job-capacity 20

# Environment variable
MIDNIGHT_PROOF_SERVER_JOB_CAPACITY=20 midnight-proof-server
```

Setting a capacity limit is recommended for production to prevent unbounded memory growth when the server receives more requests than it can process.

### `--job-timeout`

Sets the time-to-live (TTL) in seconds for each job. A background garbage collector runs every 10 seconds and removes jobs that have exceeded this timeout. Applies to jobs in any state (pending, processing).

```bash
# CLI — 5 minute timeout
midnight-proof-server --job-timeout 300

# Environment variable
MIDNIGHT_PROOF_SERVER_JOB_TIMEOUT=300 midnight-proof-server
```

The default of 600 seconds (10 minutes) is generous for most circuits. Complex circuits with high k-values may need longer timeouts. Simple circuits typically complete in under 30 seconds.

### `--no-fetch-params`

Skips the pre-fetching of ZK public parameters (k=10 through k=15) and built-in proving keys (midnight/zswap/spend, midnight/zswap/output, midnight/zswap/sign, midnight/dust/spend) on startup. This makes the server available faster but defers the fetch cost to the first proof request for each circuit.

```bash
# CLI
midnight-proof-server --no-fetch-params

# Environment variable
MIDNIGHT_PROOF_SERVER_NO_FETCH_PARAMS=true midnight-proof-server

# Docker — fast startup for development
docker run -d --name midnight-proof-server -p 6300:6300 \
  midnightntwrk/proof-server:<version> -- midnight-proof-server --no-fetch-params -v
```

## Environment Profiles

### Development

Default settings work well for development. The server starts with 2 workers and pre-fetches parameters.

```bash
docker run -d --name midnight-proof-server -p 6300:6300 \
  midnightntwrk/proof-server:<version> -- midnight-proof-server -v
```

For faster startup during iterative development, skip parameter pre-fetching:

```bash
docker run -d --name midnight-proof-server -p 6300:6300 \
  midnightntwrk/proof-server:<version> -- midnight-proof-server --no-fetch-params -v
```

### Production

Scale workers based on available CPU cores and set capacity limits to prevent resource exhaustion:

```bash
docker run -d --name midnight-proof-server -p 6300:6300 \
  --memory=8g \
  midnightntwrk/proof-server:<version> -- midnight-proof-server \
  --num-workers 8 \
  --job-capacity 50 \
  --job-timeout 300
```

### CI / Testing

Minimal configuration for automated testing where fast startup matters more than throughput:

```bash
docker run -d --name midnight-proof-server -p 6300:6300 \
  midnightntwrk/proof-server:<version> -- midnight-proof-server \
  --no-fetch-params \
  --num-workers 1 \
  --job-capacity 5
```

## Tuning Rationale

The configuration knobs map directly onto two phases of the proving pipeline. Workers control parallelism at the CPU level: each proof runs inside a `spawn_blocking` closure, pinning one physical core for its entire duration, so `--num-workers` should not exceed the cores available for proving work. The `--no-fetch-params` flag trades startup time for first-proof latency: omitting it causes the server to download ZK public parameters and built-in proving keys before the HTTP listener binds, which means the server is unavailable for several minutes but serves the first proof immediately; passing it inverts this trade-off and defers the fetch cost to the first request for each circuit. For a full description of how parameters and proving keys are stored and loaded at runtime, see `proof-server:proof-server-architecture`.

## Tuning Guidance

### Worker Count

| Scenario | Recommended `--num-workers` |
|----------|----------------------------|
| Development (local machine) | 2 (default) |
| CI / testing | 1 |
| Production (4-core) | 3-4 |
| Production (8-core) | 6-8 |
| Production (16+ core) | 12-14 (leave cores for OS/HTTP) |

Proving is CPU-bound. Each worker occupies one core during proof generation. Leave 1-2 cores free for the HTTP server, garbage collection, and OS tasks.

### Job Capacity

| Scenario | Recommended `--job-capacity` |
|----------|------------------------------|
| Development | 0 (unlimited, default) |
| Production (small) | 10-20 |
| Production (large) | 50-100 |

Unlimited capacity is fine for development where request volume is low. In production, set capacity to prevent OOM when bursts of requests arrive faster than workers can process them.

### Memory Requirements

| Configuration | Minimum RAM |
|---------------|-------------|
| Development (2 workers) | 4 GB |
| Production (4 workers) | 8 GB |
| Production (8 workers) | 16 GB |

Each worker holds proving keys and intermediate state in memory during proof generation. Complex circuits (high k-values) require more memory per worker. When running in Docker, set the container memory limit using `--memory` to match.

### Startup Time

| Mode | Typical Startup Time |
|------|---------------------|
| With pre-fetch (default) | 2-5 minutes (network and cache dependent) |
| With `--no-fetch-params` | Under 5 seconds |

Pre-fetching downloads public parameters and proving keys from the network. Subsequent starts are faster if the cache is warm. The `--no-fetch-params` flag defers this cost to the first proof request, making the server available immediately but causing a delay on the first proof for each circuit.

### Job Timeout

| Circuit Complexity | Recommended `--job-timeout` |
|-------------------|----------------------------|
| Simple (k <= 12) | 120-300 seconds |
| Medium (k = 13-15) | 300-600 seconds |
| Complex (k > 15) | 600-1200 seconds |

The default 600-second timeout accommodates most circuits. Increase it only if you observe timeout-related job cancellations in the logs for legitimate proving requests.
