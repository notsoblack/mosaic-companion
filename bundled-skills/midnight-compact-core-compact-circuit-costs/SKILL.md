# Circuit Costs & Optimization

This skill covers the cost model for Compact smart contracts across three dimensions: circuit/proving costs, runtime gas costs, and state costs. For loop and vector syntax details, see `compact-language-ref`. For ADT operation semantics, see `compact-ledger`. For hash and commitment function signatures, see `compact-standard-library`. For pure circuit declarations, see `compact-structure`.

## Three-Dimension Cost Model

Midnight contracts have three independent cost dimensions. Optimizing one may increase another.

| Dimension | What It Affects | Key Driver | Paid By |
|-----------|----------------|------------|---------|
| Circuit/Proving | Proof generation time (user-side latency) | Gate count in ZK circuit | Transaction submitter |
| Runtime/Gas | Transaction fees | readTime, computeTime, bytesWritten, bytesDeleted | Transaction submitter |
| State | Ongoing storage requirements | Ledger type choice and data volume | Network |

## Circuit Cost Quick Reference

### Loop Unrolling

All `for` loops are fully unrolled at compile time. The range `a..b` produces `b - a` iterations (upper bound is exclusive). Each iteration produces a complete copy of the loop body in the circuit.

| Pattern | Gate Cost | Example |
|---------|-----------|---------|
| `for (const i of 0..N) { body }` | N × body_cost | `0..100` with 1 add = 100 additions |
| Nested: `for i of 0..A { for j of 0..B { body } }` | A × B × body_cost | `0..10` × `0..10` = 100× body |
| Triple nested | A × B × C × body_cost | `0..9` × `0..9` × `0..9` = 729× body |

Nested loops are the most common source of circuit size explosions. A 4-level nested loop with 9 iterations each produces 6,561 copies of the innermost body.

### Hash and Commitment Function Costs

| Function | Circuit Cost | Return Type | Safe for Ledger State? | Protects from Disclosure? |
|----------|-------------|-------------|----------------------|--------------------------|
| `transientHash<T>` | **LOW** (circuit-native) | `Field` | No | No |
| `persistentHash<T>` | **HIGH** (SHA-256) | `Bytes<32>` | Yes | No |
| `transientCommit<T>` | **LOW** (circuit-native) | `Field` | No | Yes |
| `persistentCommit<T>` | **HIGH** (SHA-256) | `Bytes<32>` | Yes | Yes |

**Rule of thumb:** Use `transient*` for in-circuit consistency checks. Use `persistent*` for anything stored in ledger state. Use `degradeToTransient()`/`upgradeFromTransient()` to convert between domains.

### Pure Circuit Benefits

The `pure` modifier signals that a circuit should have no side effects. The compiler's `identify-pure-circuits` pass checks for ledger access, witness calls, and calls to impure circuits. The enforcement is contextual — the `pure` modifier primarily affects whether the circuit generates ZK proving keys and appears in `pureCircuits` exports.

| Property | Impure Circuit | Pure Circuit |
|----------|---------------|-------------|
| ZK proving keys generated | Yes | **No** |
| zkir generated | Yes | **No** |
| State transcript entries | Yes | **No** |
| Can be fully inlined | Sometimes | **Always** |
| Requires on-chain transaction | Yes | **No** |

Declare with `pure circuit` or `export pure circuit` to enforce purity and make the circuit available in TypeScript via `pureCircuits`.

### Vector Operation Costs

`map`, `fold`, and `slice` are all unrolled at compile time, just like loops.

| Operation | Cost | Example |
|-----------|------|---------|
| `map(f, vector)` | length × f_cost | `map((x) => x + x, vec10)` = 10 additions |
| `fold(f, init, vector)` | length × f_cost | `fold((acc, v) => acc + v, 0, vec10)` = 10 additions |
| `slice<N>(vector, offset)` | Zero additional gates | Compile-time extraction |
| Spread `[...vector]` | Zero additional gates | Compile-time operation |

Complex anonymous circuits inside `map`/`fold` multiply: every statement in the body is replicated per element.

### Compiler Optimizations

The compiler performs these **circuit-phase** optimization passes automatically (in order). These are a subset of the full compilation pipeline (~41 passes total across 10 frontend, 15 analysis, 11 circuit, 2 ZKIR, 2 TypeScript, and 1 metadata phase):

1. **Copy propagation** — Replaces variable references with their definitions
2. **Constant folding** — Evaluates constant expressions at compile time (`3 + 4` → `7`)
3. **Partial folding** — Simplifies expressions like `x + 0` → `x`
4. **Dead binding elimination** — Removes unreferenced const declarations
5. **Common subexpression elimination** — Reuses identical computations
6. **Known-true assert elimination** — Removes `assert(true, ...)`
7. **Disabled call elimination** — Removes calls gated by known-false conditions

These cascade: copy propagation creates dead bindings, constant folding enables copy propagation, etc. Non-literal vector indexes resolve through this cascade (e.g., `v[2 * i]` where `i = 4` becomes `v[8]`).

## Gas Model Quick Reference

| Dimension | What Contributes | Optimization Strategy |
|-----------|-----------------|----------------------|
| `readTime` | Ledger state reads (`.read()`, `.lookup()`, `.member()`) | Cache reads in local variables; avoid redundant state queries |
| `computeTime` | Circuit computation complexity | Reduce gate count; use pure circuits where possible |
| `bytesWritten` | Ledger state writes (`.insert()`, `.increment()`, field assignments) | Batch writes; minimize state mutations |
| `bytesDeleted` | Ledger state deletions (`.remove()`, `.resetToDefault()`) | Delete only when necessary |

Circuits can have a `gasLimit` set; execution fails if the limit is exceeded.

## State Cost Quick Reference

| Ledger Type | State Size | Growth Pattern | Privacy | Relative Cost |
|-------------|-----------|----------------|---------|---------------|
| Direct field (`Field`, `Bytes<N>`, etc.) | Fixed | None | Public | Lowest |
| `Counter` | Fixed (Uint\<64>) | None | Public | Low |
| `Map<K, V>` | Variable | Grows with entries | Public (keys + values visible) | Medium |
| `Set<T>` | Variable | Grows with entries | Public (elements visible) | Medium |
| `List<T>` | Variable | Grows with entries | Public | Medium |
| `MerkleTree<N, T>` | Fixed (2^N capacity) | Sparse, lazy (grows on demand) | **Insert hides leaf** (via `leaf_hash()`); **privacy via membership proofs** | Higher |
| `HistoricMerkleTree<N, T>` | Fixed + root history | Sparse, lazy + history | **Insert hides leaf** (via `leaf_hash()`); **privacy via membership proofs** | Highest |

`sealed` fields eliminate state-write circuit costs entirely since they are set once at construction.

## Cost Decision Trees

### Which Hash Function?

```
Need to store result in ledger state?
├── Yes → persistentHash / persistentCommit (SHA-256, stable across upgrades)
└── No → Is this an in-circuit consistency check only?
    ├── Yes → transientHash / transientCommit (circuit-native, much cheaper)
    └── No → Need to protect from disclosure?
        ├── Yes → transientCommit (cheap + disclosure protection)
        └── No → transientHash (cheapest option)
```

### Is My Circuit Too Expensive?

Check in order:
1. **Nested loops?** Flatten or reduce iteration counts
2. **`persistentHash` in loops?** Switch to `transientHash` if result isn't stored in ledger
3. **Unnecessary ledger reads?** Cache `.read()`/`.lookup()` results in local variables
4. **Could any sub-circuit be pure?** Extract state-independent logic into `pure circuit`
5. **Large vector operations?** Check that `map`/`fold` bodies are minimal
6. **Redundant computations?** The compiler handles CSE, but restructuring can help

### Which Ledger Type Minimizes Cost?

```
What kind of data?
├── Single numeric value → Counter (cheapest)
├── Key-value lookups → Map<K, V>
│   └── Need nested state? → Map<K, V> where V is any ledger type (Counter, Set<T>, List<T>, MerkleTree, or another Map)
├── Membership checks →
│   ├── Privacy required? → MerkleTree<N, T> (membership proofs hide which leaf)
│   └── No privacy needed? → Set<T> (cheaper, simpler)
├── Ordered sequence → List<T> (front-access only)
└── Single immutable value → sealed ledger field (zero ongoing cost)
```

## Common Expensive Patterns

| Expensive Pattern | Better Alternative | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Nested loops when a flat loop suffices | Restructure to single loop | Nested loops multiply gate count |
| `persistentHash` inside a loop body | `transientHash` if result isn't stored | SHA-256 costs many more gates than circuit-native hash |
| Impure circuit that only computes from inputs | Refactor to `pure circuit` | Avoids zkir/key generation and state transcript |
| Repeated `.read()` / `.lookup()` on same key | Cache in `const` and reuse | Each ledger operation has gas cost |
| Complex computation in `map`/`fold` body | Extract to named pure circuit | Clearer and enables the compiler to optimize better |
| Large MerkleTree when Set would suffice | Use `Set<T>` if privacy not needed | MerkleTree has higher state cost and requires path proofs |
| Unsealed field used as immutable config | Use `sealed ledger` | Sealed eliminates state-write circuits entirely |
