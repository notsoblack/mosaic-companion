# Proof Server Operations

Operational guide for monitoring, health checking, troubleshooting, and capacity planning the Midnight proof server. For basic Docker setup, see `midnight-tooling:proof-server`. For configuration flags, see `proof-server:proof-server-configuration`. For architecture internals, see `proof-server:proof-server-architecture`.

> Replace `<version>` in image tags below with the version matching your target Midnight network. Check `midnight-tooling:release-notes` for current versions.

## Monitoring

### Key Endpoint: `/ready`

The `/ready` endpoint is the primary operational monitoring surface. It reports worker pool utilization in real time.

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:6300/ready | jq .
```

```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "jobsProcessing": 1,
  "jobsPending": 3,
  "jobCapacity": 20,
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00.000Z"
}
```

| Field | Meaning | Action Threshold |
|-------|---------|-----------------|
| `status` | `"ok"` = accepting work, `"busy"` = queue full | Alert on sustained `"busy"` |
| `jobsProcessing` | Active proving tasks (one per worker) | Should be <= `--num-workers` |
| `jobsPending` | Queued tasks waiting for a worker | Rising trend = need more workers |
| `jobCapacity` | Max queue depth (0 = unlimited) | Should match `--job-capacity` |

### HTTP Status Codes for Monitoring

| Endpoint | Code | Meaning |
|----------|------|---------|
| `/health` | 200 | Server process is alive |
| `/ready` | 200 | Server is accepting proving requests |
| `/ready` | 503 | Job queue is full, server is busy (only when `--job-capacity > 0`; default 0 = unlimited, so 503 is never returned from `/ready` by default) |
| `/prove` | 429 | Request rejected, capacity limit reached |

### Pre-warming Parameters

Use `/fetch-params/{k}` to pre-warm the parameter cache for specific circuit sizes (only available when the server was started without `--no-fetch-params`):

```bash
# Pre-warm parameters for k-value 13
curl -sf http://localhost:6300/fetch-params/13
```

### Monitoring Script

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Check proof server operational status
# Requires: curl, jq
READY=$(curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" http://localhost:6300/ready)
if [ "$READY" = "200" ]; then
  STATS=$(curl -s http://localhost:6300/ready)
  PROCESSING=$(echo "$STATS" | jq -r '.jobsProcessing')
  PENDING=$(echo "$STATS" | jq -r '.jobsPending')
  CAPACITY=$(echo "$STATS" | jq -r '.jobCapacity')
  echo "OK: processing=$PROCESSING pending=$PENDING capacity=$CAPACITY"
elif [ "$READY" = "503" ]; then
  echo "BUSY: proof server at capacity"
else
  echo "DOWN: proof server not responding (HTTP $READY)"
fi
```

## Health Check Patterns

### Docker Health Check

Add a health check to the Docker run command:

```bash
docker run -d --name midnight-proof-server \
  -p 6300:6300 \
  --health-cmd="curl -sf http://localhost:6300/health || exit 1" \
  --health-interval=30s \
  --health-timeout=10s \
  --health-retries=3 \
  midnightntwrk/proof-server:<version> -- midnight-proof-server -v
```

### Docker Compose Health Check

```yaml
services:
  proof-server:
    image: midnightntwrk/proof-server:<version>
    command: ["midnight-proof-server", "-v"]
    ports:
      - "6300:6300"
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "curl", "-sf", "http://localhost:6300/health"]
      interval: 30s
      timeout: 10s
      retries: 3
      start_period: 300s
```

The `start_period` of 300 seconds (5 minutes) accounts for the parameter pre-fetch phase. The pre-fetch runs *before* the HTTP listener binds, so during this phase the health check cannot connect at all (`/health` itself is unreachable, not just slow to become ready). The generous `start_period` prevents these expected connection failures from marking the container unhealthy until the port is bound and `/health` starts answering.

### Kubernetes Probes

```yaml
livenessProbe:
  httpGet:
    path: /health
    port: 6300
  initialDelaySeconds: 10
  periodSeconds: 30
  timeoutSeconds: 5
readinessProbe:
  httpGet:
    path: /ready
    port: 6300
  initialDelaySeconds: 120
  periodSeconds: 10
  timeoutSeconds: 5
```

Use `/health` for liveness (is the process alive?) and `/ready` for readiness (can it handle proving requests?). The readiness probe returns 503 when the server is at capacity, which causes Kubernetes to stop routing traffic to the pod.

> **Note:** During startup, while the server is pre-fetching ZK parameters (the default behavior without `--no-fetch-params`), the HTTP listener is not yet bound — the parameter pre-fetch completes *before* the server starts listening. As a result, **both** `/health` and `/ready` are unreachable (connection refused) during pre-fetch, rather than returning 200/503. This is expected behavior, not an error. Once parameter pre-fetch completes the server binds its port and both endpoints become reachable; pre-fetch can take 2-5 minutes depending on network speed and cache state. `/ready` returns 503 only after the server is listening, when the job queue is full.

## Log Analysis

> For a structured reference of all log patterns, verbosity levels, and the full monitoring script, see `references/logging-and-monitoring.md`.

### Enabling Verbose Logs

Start the proof server with `-v` (or `--verbose`) to enable DEBUG-level logging:

```bash
docker run -d --name midnight-proof-server -p 6300:6300 \
  midnightntwrk/proof-server:<version> -- midnight-proof-server -v
```

### Viewing Logs

```bash
# Recent logs
docker logs --tail 50 midnight-proof-server

# Follow logs in real time
docker logs -f midnight-proof-server

# Logs with timestamps
docker logs --timestamps midnight-proof-server
```

### Key Log Patterns

| Log Pattern | Level | Meaning |
|-------------|-------|---------|
| `Ensuring zswap key material is available...` | INFO | Startup parameter pre-fetch beginning (logged before the HTTP port binds) |
| `Starting to process request for /k...` | INFO | A `/k` request has been received and is being processed (analogous lines exist for `/check`, `/prove`, and `/prove-tx`) |
| `Received request: ...` | DEBUG | Hex dump of the raw request body (only emitted in verbose mode) |

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

| Symptom | Likely Cause | Resolution |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| `/ready` returns 503 continuously | All workers busy and queue full | Increase `--num-workers` or `--job-capacity` |
| `/prove` returns 429 | Job capacity limit reached | Increase `--job-capacity` or add more workers |
| `/prove` returns 400 | Malformed or undeserializable binary request (the tagged payload failed to parse) | Check that the client SDK version matches the proof server version |
| `/prove` returns 500 | Internal proving error (including a genuinely unsupported, non-V2 proof version, which trips an internal `unreachable!()` rather than a clean 400) | Enable verbose mode (`-v`), check logs for stack trace |
| Proofs take very long | Complex circuit or insufficient CPU | Check k-value of circuit; increase `--num-workers` |
| Server exits on startup | Insufficient memory or port conflict | Check Docker memory allocation (min 4 GB); verify port 6300 is free |
| First proof is slow | Parameter fetch on first use (`--no-fetch-params`) | Pre-warm with `/fetch-params/{k}` or remove `--no-fetch-params` |
| Jobs being cancelled | TTL exceeded (`--job-timeout` too low) | Increase `--job-timeout` for complex circuits |
| High memory usage | Too many workers or complex circuits | Reduce `--num-workers` or increase Docker memory limit |

### Diagnostic Checklist

When the proof server is not behaving as expected, run through these checks in order:

```bash
# 1. Is the container running?
docker ps --filter "name=midnight-proof-server"

# 2. Is the process alive?
curl -sf http://localhost:6300/health

# 3. Is it accepting work?
curl -sf http://localhost:6300/ready

# 4. What version is running?
curl -sf http://localhost:6300/version

# 5. What proof versions are supported?
curl -sf http://localhost:6300/proof-versions

# 6. Check recent logs for errors
docker logs --tail 50 midnight-proof-server

# 7. Check container resource usage
docker stats midnight-proof-server --no-stream
```

### Version Mismatch Issues

The proof server, Compact compiler, and wallet SDK must use compatible versions. A version mismatch typically manifests as:

- `/prove` returning 400 (binary deserialization failure)
- `/check` returning unexpected results, or `/prove` returning 500 (internal circuit error)
- Proofs that generate successfully but fail on-chain verification

Check versions across all components:

```bash
# Proof server version
curl -sf http://localhost:6300/version

# Compact compiler version
compactc --version
```

## Capacity Planning

### Throughput Estimation

Proof generation is CPU-intensive. Each proof runs in a `spawn_blocking` thread, occupying one CPU core for its duration.

| Circuit Complexity (k-value) | Approx. Proving Time (per proof) |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------------|
| k = 10-11 | 5-15 seconds |
| k = 12-13 | 15-60 seconds |
| k = 14-15 | 1-5 minutes |
| k > 15 | 5+ minutes |

### Throughput by Worker Count

For a circuit with ~30 second proving time:

| Workers | Max Throughput | Recommended RAM |
|---------|---------------|-----------------|
| 1 | ~2 proofs/min | 4 GB |
| 2 | ~4 proofs/min | 4 GB |
| 4 | ~8 proofs/min | 8 GB |
| 8 | ~16 proofs/min | 16 GB |

### Scaling Strategy

```text
Single Instance (vertical scaling)
├── Increase --num-workers for more parallelism
├── Increase --job-capacity for burst absorption
└── Increase Docker memory allocation

Multiple Instances (horizontal scaling)
├── Run multiple proof server containers
├── Load balance with /ready-aware health checks
└── Use Kubernetes HPA on CPU utilization
```

## Performance Characteristics

- **CPU-intensive:** Proof generation dominates resource usage; each proof uses one core continuously
- **Memory per worker:** Each worker holds proving keys and intermediate computation state; memory usage scales with worker count and circuit complexity
- **I/O minimal:** After startup parameter fetch, the server has negligible disk and network I/O
- **Latency profile:** First proof may be slow (parameter fetch if `--no-fetch-params`); subsequent proofs have consistent latency determined by circuit complexity
- **Garbage collection:** Background GC runs every 10 seconds, removing timed-out jobs; negligible CPU overhead
