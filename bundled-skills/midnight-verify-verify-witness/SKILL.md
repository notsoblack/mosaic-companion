description: >-
  Witness claim classification and method routing. Determines what kind of
  witness claim is being verified and dispatches to the witness-verifier.
  Handles claims about witness type correctness, name matching, return tuple
  shape, type mappings, behavioral correctness, private state patterns, and
  two-file verification. Loaded by the /midnight-verify:verify command alongside the hub skill.

# Witness Claim Classification

This skill classifies witness-related claims and determines which agent(s) to dispatch. The /midnight-verify:verify command loads this alongside the `midnight-verify:verify-correctness` hub skill.

## Claim Type → Method Routing

When you receive a witness-related claim, classify it using this table:

### Claims About the Contract-Witness Interface

| Claim Type | Example | Dispatch |
|---|---|---|
| Witness type correctness | "This witness correctly implements the contract interface" | @"midnight-verify:witness-verifier (agent)" |
| Witness name matching | "The witness names match the contract declarations" | @"midnight-verify:witness-verifier (agent)" |
| Witness return type | "This witness returns the correct [PrivateState, ReturnValue] tuple" | @"midnight-verify:witness-verifier (agent)" |
| Type mapping correctness | "The Field parameters map to bigint in the witness" | @"midnight-verify:witness-verifier (agent)" |
| WitnessContext usage | "This witness correctly uses the ledger from WitnessContext" | @"midnight-verify:witness-verifier (agent)" |
| Private state patterns | "This witness doesn't mutate private state in place" | @"midnight-verify:witness-verifier (agent)" |

### Claims About Witness Behavior

| Claim Type | Example | Dispatch |
|---|---|---|
| Behavioral correctness | "This contract + witness combination produces valid results" | @"midnight-verify:witness-verifier (agent)" |
| Two-file verification | `/midnight-verify:verify contracts/counter.compact src/witnesses.ts` | @"midnight-verify:witness-verifier (agent)" (both files) |
| Witness + devnet E2E | "This witness works correctly when deployed" | @"midnight-verify:witness-verifier (agent)" + @"midnight-verify:sdk-tester (agent)" (concurrent) |

### Cross-Domain Claims

| Claim Type | Example | Dispatch |
|---|---|---|
| Witness + ZK proof | "This contract + witness produces a valid ZK proof" | @"midnight-verify:witness-verifier (agent)" first, then @"midnight-verify:zkir-checker (agent)" (sequential — witness-verifier passes build output path) |

### Routing Rules

**When in doubt:**
- Claims about the contract-witness interface → @"midnight-verify:witness-verifier (agent)"
- Claims about just the TypeScript types (no contract involved) → @"midnight-verify:type-checker (agent)" (existing SDK path)
- Claims about just the Compact declarations (no witness implementation) → @"midnight-verify:contract-writer (agent)" (existing Compact path)

**For Witness + ZKIR claims:** dispatch @"midnight-verify:witness-verifier (agent)" first (it compiles and verifies), then pass the build output path to @"midnight-verify:zkir-checker (agent)". These are sequential, not concurrent, because the zkir-checker depends on the compiled artifacts.

## Hints from Existing Skills

The @"midnight-verify:witness-verifier (agent)" may load these skills for context. They are **hints only** — never cite skill content as evidence.

- `compact-core:compact-witness-ts` skill — witness implementation patterns, WitnessContext API, type mappings
- `compact-core:compact-structure` skill — witness declarations, disclosure rules
