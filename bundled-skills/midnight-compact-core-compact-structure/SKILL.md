# Compact Smart Contract Structure

Every Compact program follows a consistent anatomy that maps directly to on-chain state, ZK circuit generation, and off-chain prover integration.

## Contract Anatomy

A Compact contract is organized in this order:

```compact
pragma language_version >= 0.22;

import CompactStandardLibrary;

// 1. Custom types (enums, structs)
export enum State { active, inactive }
export struct Config { threshold: Uint<64>, admin: Bytes<32> }

// 2. Ledger declarations (on-chain state)
export ledger owner: Bytes<32>;
export sealed ledger config: Config;
export ledger state: State;
export ledger balances: Map<Bytes<32>, Uint<64>>;

// 3. Witness declarations (off-chain data providers)
witness local_secret_key(): Bytes<32>;

// 4. Constructor (one-time initialization)
constructor(threshold: Uint<64>) {
  owner = disclose(get_public_key(local_secret_key()));
  config = disclose(Config { threshold: threshold, admin: owner });
  state = State.active;
}

// 5. Helper circuits (internal logic)
circuit get_public_key(sk: Bytes<32>): Bytes<32> {
  return persistentHash<Vector<2, Bytes<32>>>([
    pad(32, "myapp:pk:"), sk
  ]);
}

// 6. Exported circuits (transaction entry points)
export circuit do_something(): [] {
  assert(state == State.active, "Contract inactive");
  // ... logic
}
```

## Pragma and Imports

Every contract starts with a version pragma and standard library import:

```compact
pragma language_version >= 0.22;
import CompactStandardLibrary;
```

> **Tip:** Run `compact compile --language-version` to check which language version your compiler supports.

The pragma specifies a minimum version without patch numbers. The standard library provides `persistentHash`, `persistentCommit` (takes `rand: Bytes<32>` parameter), `transientHash`, and `transientCommit`. Language built-ins include `pad`, `disclose`, `assert`, and `default`.

## Data Types Quick Reference

| Category | Types |
|----------|-------|
| **Primitives** | `Field`, `Boolean`, `Bytes<N>`, `Uint<N>`, `Uint<0..MAX>` |
| **Collections** | `Vector<N, T>`, `Maybe<T>`, `Either<L, R>` |
| **Ledger ADTs** | `Counter`, `Map<K, V>`, `Set<T>`, `List<T>`, `MerkleTree<N, T>`, `HistoricMerkleTree<N, T>` |
| **Opaque** | `Opaque<"string">`, `Opaque<"Uint8Array">` |
| **Custom** | `enum`, `struct` |

For detailed type documentation, operations, and casting rules, consult `references/data-types.md`.

## Ledger Declarations

Ledger fields define on-chain state. Three modifiers control visibility and mutability:

```compact
export ledger publicField: Field;           // Public, readable externally
ledger privateField: Field;                 // Not exported, internal only
export sealed ledger immutable: Bytes<32>;  // Set once in constructor, immutable
```

All ledger operations (reads, writes, ADT method calls) are publicly visible on-chain except for `MerkleTree` and `HistoricMerkleTree` insertions, which store values using cryptographic hashes.

For ADT operations (Counter, Map, Set, List, MerkleTree), consult `references/ledger-declarations.md`.

## Circuits

Circuits are on-chain functions that produce ZK proofs. Return type is `[]` (empty tuple), not `Void`.

```compact
export circuit transfer(to: Bytes<32>, amount: Uint<64>): [] { ... }
circuit internal_helper(): Bytes<32> { ... }
export pure circuit compute(x: Field): Field { ... }
```

- `export` makes the circuit a transaction entry point
- `pure` signals no side effects — the compiler's `identify-pure-circuits` pass checks for ledger access, witness calls, and calls to impure circuits. Primarily affects ZK proving key generation and `pureCircuits` export
- Non-exported circuits are internal helpers

For circuit rules, witness declarations, constructors, and pure circuits, consult `references/circuits-and-witnesses.md`.

## Witnesses

Witnesses provide off-chain data to circuits. Declaration only in Compact — implementation is in TypeScript:

```compact
witness local_secret_key(): Bytes<32>;
witness get_user_data(id: Bytes<32>): Maybe<UserRecord>;
witness store_locally(data: Field): [];
```

Witnesses run locally on the prover's machine. Their values are confidential but untrusted by the contract.

## Key Rules

### Disclosure

Values flowing from witnesses to ledger operations or conditionals require `disclose()`:

```compact
// Conditional on witness value
if (disclose(caller == owner)) { ... }

// Writing witness-derived value to ledger
owner = disclose(get_public_key(local_secret_key()));
```

### Enum Syntax

Use dot notation, not Rust-style double colons:

```compact
state = State.active;       // Correct
state = State::active;      // Wrong - parse error
```

### Type Casting

Use `as` keyword. Some casts require intermediate steps:

```compact
const f: Field = myUint as Field;              // Uint -> Field (safe)
const b: Bytes<32> = (amount as Field) as Bytes<32>;  // Uint -> Bytes (via Field)
const u: Uint<0..1> = flag as Uint<0..1>;      // Boolean -> Uint
```

### Exports for TypeScript

To access types from the TypeScript DApp, export them:

```compact
export enum GameState { waiting, playing }
export struct Config { value: Field }
export { Maybe, Either }   // Re-export stdlib types
```

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Correct |
|---------|---------|
| `ledger { field: Type; }` | `export ledger field: Type;` |
| `circuit fn(): Void` | `circuit fn(): []` |
| `pragma >= 0.20.0` | `pragma >= 0.20` |
| `enum State { ... }` (no export) | `export enum State { ... }` |
| `if (witness_val == x)` | `if (disclose(witness_val == x))` |
| `Cell<Field>` | `Field` (Cell implicit, cannot be written) |
| `public_key(sk)` | `persistentHash<...>([pad(...), sk])` |
| `counter.value()` | `counter.read()` |
| `Choice::rock` | `Choice.rock` |
| `pure function helper()` | `pure circuit helper()` |
| `witness fn(): T { body }` | `witness fn(): T;` (no body) |

For comprehensive mistake documentation with explanations, consult `references/common-mistakes.md`.

## Common Patterns

- **Authentication** — Hash-based identity verification using `persistentHash`
- **Commit-Reveal** — Two-phase schemes for hidden-then-revealed values
- **Disclosure in conditionals** — Wrapping witness comparisons in `disclose()`
- **Merkle tree membership** — Privacy-preserving set membership proofs
- **Counter-based rounds** — Breaking user linkability across transactions

For complete pattern implementations with code, consult `references/patterns.md`.
