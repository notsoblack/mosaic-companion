# Verify by Source Code Inspection

You are verifying a claim about Compact or Midnight by reading the actual source code of the compiler, ledger, runtime, or related repositories. Follow these steps in order.

## When This Method Is Used

This method is for claims that **cannot be meaningfully tested by compiling and running code**:

- Language feature counts ("Compact exports 57 primitives")
- Internal implementation details ("Compact compiler is written in Scheme")
- Architectural rationale ("Compact chose Field as the base type because...")
- Cross-component contracts ("Compiled output follows format X")
- Protocol-level behavior that isn't observable from a single contract execution
- SDK export counts ("midnight-js-contracts exports 91 symbols")
- SDK implementation details ("proof provider retries 3 times with backoff")
- SDK provider internals ("LevelDB provider uses AES-256-GCM encryption")

If the claim CAN be tested by writing and running a contract, the contract-writer agent handles it instead. You only run when execution isn't viable.

## Using compact-core Skills as Hints

You may consult compact-core skills to get a starting point for where to look. They can tell you which stdlib functions are expected to exist, what the type system looks like, etc. But they are **hints only** — the source code is your evidence, not the skills.

## Step 1: Determine Where to Look

**Repository routing — match the claim to the right repo:**

| Claim About | Primary Repo | Key Paths / Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Compiler behavior, language semantics, stdlib | `LFDT-Minokawa/compact` | `compiler/` directory, `midnight-natives.ss` for stdlib exports |
| Compiler-generated docs (good secondary source) | `LFDT-Minokawa/compact` | `docs/` — generated from source, more reliable than general Midnight docs |
| Ledger types, transaction structure, token ops | `midnightntwrk/midnight-ledger` | Rust source — defines Counter, Map, Set, MerkleTree, transaction validation |
| ZK proof system, circuit compilation | `midnightntwrk/midnight-zk` | Rust source — proof generation, ZKIR, circuit constraints |
| Node runtime, on-chain execution | `midnightntwrk/midnight-node` | Rust source — how transactions execute on-chain |
| Compact CLI releases, changelog | `midnightntwrk/compact` | Release notes — distinct from LFDT-Minokawa/compact compiler source |
| SDK API, TypeScript packages, provider implementations | `midnightntwrk/midnight-js` | `packages/*/src/` — monorepo with 13 packages. `llms.txt` in repo root is a 10KB API overview useful as a starting point. |

If the claim doesn't clearly map to one repo, start with `LFDT-Minokawa/compact` for language/compiler claims or `midnightntwrk/midnight-ledger` for protocol/transaction claims.

## Step 2: Search with octocode-mcp

Start with targeted lookups using the `octocode-mcp` tools:

1. **`githubSearchCode`** — search for specific function names, type names, export definitions
2. **`githubGetFileContent`** — read a specific file once you know the path
3. **`githubViewRepoStructure`** — understand the repo layout if you're not sure where to look

**Search strategy:**

- Start narrow: search for the exact term from the claim (function name, type name, keyword)
- If no results, broaden: search for related terms or parent concepts
- Check multiple files if the claim is about something spread across the codebase

**Evaluate results critically:**

- Are you looking at the right branch? Default branch is usually `main` or `master`
- Is this the current version, or an old commit?
- Does the file you found actually contain the information you need, or just a reference to it?

## Step 3: Clone Locally if Needed

If octocode-mcp results are insufficient — you need to trace through multiple files, count exports across modules, or understand control flow — clone the repo locally:

```bash
# Clone to a temp directory
CLONE_DIR=$(mktemp -d)
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/<org>/<repo>.git "$CLONE_DIR/<repo>"
```

Use `--depth 1` for shallow clones (faster, we usually only need the latest state).

After investigation, clean up:

```bash
rm -rf "$CLONE_DIR"
```

## Step 4: Read and Interpret Source

**What counts as evidence (ordered by strength):**

1. **Function/type/export definitions in source code** — strong evidence. If the source defines a function with signature X, that's definitive.
2. **Test files in the repo** — good evidence. Tests express intended behavior. If a test asserts X, the developers intend X to be true.
3. **Generated docs in `LFDT-Minokawa/compact/docs/`** — good evidence, but note that it's generated from source, not raw source itself. More reliable than general Midnight docs, less authoritative than the code.
4. **Comments in source code** — supporting context only. Comments can be stale. Never use a comment as primary evidence.

**Watch for:**

- Version-specific behavior: the source on `main` may differ from the released version the user is targeting
- Unreleased changes: code on `main` might include features not yet in any release
- Multiple implementations: some behaviors have different implementations for different contexts (e.g., native vs WASM)

## Step 5: Report

**Your report must include:**

1. **The claim as received** — verbatim
2. **Where you looked** — repo name, file path(s), line numbers
3. **What the source shows** — quote or summarize the relevant code
4. **GitHub links** — full URLs to the exact files/lines (e.g., `https://github.com/LFDT-Minokawa/compact/blob/main/compiler/midnight-natives.ss#L42`)
5. **Your interpretation** — does the source confirm, refute, or leave the claim inconclusive?

**Report format:**

```
### Source Investigation Report

**Claim:** [verbatim]

**Searched:** [repo(s) and method — octocode-mcp search / local clone]

**Found:**
- File: [repo/path/to/file.ext:line-range]
- Link: [full GitHub URL]
- Content: [relevant code snippet or summary]

**Interpretation:** [Confirmed / Refuted / Inconclusive] — [explanation of what the source shows and how it relates to the claim]
```

If inconclusive, explain:
- What you searched and why it wasn't definitive
- What further investigation might resolve it (different repo, different approach, needs runtime testing)
