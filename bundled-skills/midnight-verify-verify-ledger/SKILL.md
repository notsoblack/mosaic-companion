  Ledger/protocol claim classification and method routing. Determines what kind
  of ledger claim is being verified and which verification methods apply:
  source investigation (primary), type-checking (pre-flight for TypeScript API),
  compilation/execution (secondary for testable claims), or ledger-v8 execution
  (secondary for API behavioral claims). Handles claims about transaction
  structure, token mechanics (Night/Zswap/Dust), cost model, on-chain VM,
  contract execution, cryptographic primitives, well-formedness rules, and the
  @midnight-ntwrk/ledger-v8 TypeScript API. Loaded by the /midnight-verify:verify command
  alongside the hub skill.

# Ledger/Protocol Claim Classification

This skill classifies ledger and protocol claims and determines which verification method to use. The /midnight-verify:verify command loads this alongside the `midnight-verify:verify-correctness` hub skill.

## Verification Flow

Ledger claims have a richer verification hierarchy than other domains because the ledger crates produce the compiled output that the contract-writer and zkir-checker already work with.

1. **Type-check (pre-flight)** — for TypeScript API claims only. Dispatch @"midnight-verify:type-checker (agent)" against the existing sdk-workspace (ledger-v8 is already installed). Pre-flight only, never a standalone verdict.
2. **Source investigation (primary)** — always runs for protocol claims. Dispatch @"midnight-verify:source-investigator (agent)", which loads `verify-by-ledger-source` for Rust crate-level routing.
3. **Compilation/execution (secondary)** — for claims testable via Compact contracts. Dispatch @"midnight-verify:contract-writer (agent)" (compile + execute, extract ledger-level evidence) or @"midnight-verify:zkir-checker (agent)" (inspect compiled circuits).
4. **Ledger-v8 execution (secondary)** — for claims about TypeScript API behavioral output. Write a script that calls ledger-v8 functions and observes output.

### Routing Rules

**When in doubt:**
- Protocol structure, token mechanics, crypto primitives → @"midnight-verify:source-investigator (agent)" (Rust source is authoritative)
- TypeScript API surface → @"midnight-verify:type-checker (agent)" pre-flight + @"midnight-verify:source-investigator (agent)" (trace WASM binding to Rust)
- Testable behavior (cost, well-formedness, token operations) → @"midnight-verify:source-investigator (agent)" + @"midnight-verify:contract-writer (agent)" or ledger-v8 execution as secondary
- Formal properties → @"midnight-verify:source-investigator (agent)" only (these are about the proof structure in code)

**Source investigation is always primary.** Secondary methods (compilation, execution) provide corroborating evidence but are not required for a verdict.
