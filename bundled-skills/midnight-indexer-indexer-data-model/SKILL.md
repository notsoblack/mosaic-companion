# Indexer Data Model

The Midnight indexer extracts and stores on-chain data into a relational database, making it queryable through the GraphQL API. This skill covers what gets indexed, the database schema, and the relationships between entities.

## What Gets Indexed

The indexer processes every finalized block and extracts nine categories of data:

1. **Blocks** — Hash, height, timestamp, author, parent hash, protocol version
2. **Transactions** — Regular and System variants with hashes, identifiers, raw content, and Merkle tree roots
3. **Contract actions** — Deploy, Call, and Update events with contract address, state, zswap state, and entry point
4. **Contract balances** — Unshielded token balances per contract action
5. **Unshielded UTXOs** — Creation and spending tracking, owner addresses, token types, DUST registration status
6. **Ledger events** — Zswap events (inputs/outputs) and DUST events (initial UTXOs, dtime updates, spend processing, parameter changes)
7. **DUST generation** — cNIGHT registrations from Cardano, generation rate and capacity tracking
8. **System parameters** — D-parameter history (stored in the `system_parameters_d` table) and Terms & Conditions history (stored in the `system_parameters_terms_and_conditions` table)
9. **SPO data** — Identities, committee membership, epoch performance, stake distribution, pool metadata

## Database Schema

The tables below are grouped by purpose. For the **complete** catalog — every table, all columns and types, primary keys, indexes, the full foreign-key map, and the Postgres-vs-SQLite divergences — see `references/database-schema.md`.

### Core Tables

| Table | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `blocks` | Block metadata — hash, height, timestamp, block author |
| `transactions` | Transaction records — variant (Regular/System), hash, raw bytes |
| `regular_transactions` | Extended data for regular transactions — result, Merkle root, fees |

### Contract Tables

| Table | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `contract_actions` | Deploy, Call, and Update events — contract address, state snapshot |
| `contract_balances` | Token balances associated with each contract action |

### Token and UTXO Tables

| Table | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `unshielded_utxos` | UTXO lifecycle tracking — creation, spending, owner address, token type |
| `ledger_events` | Zswap events (inputs/outputs) and DUST events |
| `dust_generation_info` | NIGHT UTXO tracking for DUST generation |
| `cnight_registrations` | Cardano stake key to Midnight address mappings |

### Wallet Tables

| Table | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `wallets` | Wallet sessions with encrypted viewing keys |
| `relevant_transactions` | Wallet-to-transaction association for shielded scanning |

When a wallet connects via the `connect` mutation, its viewing key is encrypted using `APP__INFRA__SECRET` and stored in the `wallets` table. The wallet-indexer then scans each new block, attempting to decrypt transaction outputs with the viewing key. Transactions that decrypt successfully are "relevant" to that wallet and inserted into `relevant_transactions`, a many-to-many join table linking `wallets` to `transactions`. This join table enables the `shieldedTransactions` subscription to stream only the transactions a specific wallet can view.

### Governance and SPO Tables

| Table | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `system_parameters_d` | D-parameter history (governance) |
| `system_parameters_terms_and_conditions` | Terms & Conditions history (governance) |
| `epochs` | Epoch boundary records |
| `spo_identity` | Stake pool operator identity records |
| `committee_membership` | SPO committee membership tracking |

  └── relevant_transactions (N:M with transactions)
```

## Contract Action Types

The indexer records three independent kinds of contract action as they occur. They are peer variants, not stages of a fixed sequence: a contract begins with a Deploy, and any number of Call and Update actions can follow in whatever order they happen on-chain. Update is contract maintenance (new verifier keys / state) — it is not a mandatory terminal step that closes out a contract.

```text
Deploy            Call             Update
  │                │                 │
  ▼                ▼                 ▼
Initial          Entry           New verifier
state            point           keys / state
                 exec
```

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Deploy** | Contract is deployed to the network with initial state and verifier keys |
| **Call** | Contract entry point is invoked, state is updated |
| **Update** | Contract verifier keys or operations are updated (contract maintenance) |

Each action records:
- The contract address
- The resulting contract state
- The resulting zswap state
- The parent transaction
- Any unshielded token balances

## Transaction Variants

| Variant | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Regular** | User-submitted transactions with ZK proofs, contract calls, and token operations |
| **System** | Protocol-generated transactions (epoch boundaries, parameter updates) |

Regular transactions include additional fields:
- `result` — SUCCESS, PARTIAL_SUCCESS, or FAILURE
- `merkle_root` — Commitment tree root at time of transaction
- `fees` — Paid and estimated fees

## Unshielded UTXO Tracking

The indexer tracks the full lifecycle of unshielded UTXOs:

```text
Created (in contract action)
  │
  ├── Owner address recorded
  ├── Token type recorded
  ├── DUST registration status tracked
  │
  ▼
Spent (in later transaction)
  │
  └── Spending transaction recorded
```

## DUST Generation Data

The indexer tracks DUST (Decentralized Unshielded Staking Token) generation:
- **cNIGHT registrations** — Cardano stake keys mapped to Midnight addresses
- **Generation rate** — How quickly DUST accrues
- **Capacity** — Maximum DUST that can be generated
- **Initial UTXOs, dtime updates, spend processing, parameter changes** — All tracked as DUST ledger events
