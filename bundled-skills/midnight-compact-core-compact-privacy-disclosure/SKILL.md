# Compact Privacy & Disclosure

This skill covers the privacy dimension of Compact: understanding what is private by default, when and how to disclose, and how to build contracts that preserve user privacy. For visibility rules per ledger operation, see `compact-ledger`. For contract anatomy and circuit/witness design, see `compact-structure`. For standard library function signatures, see `compact-standard-library`. For shielded token privacy, see `compact-tokens`.

## Midnight's Privacy Model

Privacy is the default in Compact. All witness-derived data is private unless explicitly disclosed. The compiler's **Witness Protection Program** (an abstract interpreter) tracks which values contain witness data at every point in the program. When a tagged value reaches a public boundary (ledger write, conditional, exported circuit return, cross-contract call) without a `disclose()` wrapper, the compiler halts with an error reporting the full path from witness source to disclosure point.

`disclose()` is a compiler annotation, not a runtime operation. It does not encrypt, hash, or transform the value. Placing `disclose(x)` simply marks `x` as "okay to make public." The programmer is asserting: "I understand this value will be visible on-chain, and that is intentional."

## Visibility vs. Taint (Two Different Properties)

These are routinely conflated and must be kept separate:

- **Witness taint** (compile-time concept). The compiler tags every value returned from a `witness` function, every exported circuit parameter, and every constructor parameter as "potentially private." Taint propagates through arithmetic, struct construction, circuit calls, casts, lambda captures. The compiler enforces taint at every public boundary, where `disclose()` is the only way to clear it.
- **Public transcript visibility** (on-chain reality). A value only enters the public transaction transcript if the source code crosses a public boundary with that value while it is still tainted (or via an unprotected return / ledger write / cross-contract call / public conditional). Values that are not disclosed remain PLONK *private inputs* to the proof and are never observable on-chain.

**Exported circuit parameters are private by default.** They are PLONK private inputs. They become publicly visible only when the circuit body crosses a public boundary with them. A parameter that is consumed only by witness calls, commitments, internal hashes, or private asserts is never observable on-chain. Verified empirically: a contract with `export circuit addPrivately(amount, rand) { lastHash = persistentCommit(amount, rand); }` produces a transaction whose `publicTranscript` contains only the 32-byte commitment hash — the raw `amount` value is absent.

The corollary: a value being "tagged with witness taint" does NOT mean it is publicly visible — it means the compiler is watching it. Tagging is a safety mechanism; visibility is what actually reaches the chain.

## Privacy Decision Tree

| What to Protect | Approach | Key Primitives |
|----------------|----------|----------------|
| Hide a value on-chain | Commitment | `persistentCommit<T>` / `transientCommit<T>` |
| Prove membership anonymously | MerkleTree + ZK path | `HistoricMerkleTree` + `merkleTreePathRoot<N, T>` |
| Prevent double-actions | Nullifier | `persistentHash<T>([domain, secret])` + `Set<Bytes<32>>` |
| Hide who is acting | Unlinkable auth | `Counter` + rotated `persistentHash` |
| Multi-step hidden value | Commit-reveal | Commit phase + reveal phase |
| Private token balances | Shielded tokens | zswap infrastructure (see `compact-tokens`) |
| Share specific data only | Selective disclosure | `disclose()` on boolean result, not the value |

## Disclosure Rules Quick Reference

**When `disclose()` IS required:**

| Context | Example | Why |
|---------|---------|-----|
| Ledger write (direct) | `owner = disclose(pk)` | Value becomes public on-chain |
| Ledger write (ADT method) | `map.insert(disclose(key), val)` | Arguments to ADT ops are public |
| Conditional (`if`) with ledger writes | `if (disclose(x == y)) { balance = ... }` | Branch choice reveals information when it contains ledger writes |
| Return from exported circuit | `return disclose(value)` | Return value leaves the ZK proof |
| Cross-contract call | Calling another contract's circuit | Arguments cross trust boundary |
| Constructor sealed field | `owner = disclose(pk)` | Sealed values are set publicly |

**When `disclose()` is NOT required:**

| Context | Example | Why |
|---------|---------|-----|
| Pure witness computation | `const h = persistentHash<Bytes<32>>(sk)` | Result stays within circuit |
| Internal circuit calls | `helper(witness_val)` | Non-exported, stays in proof |
| Intermediate variables | `const x = a + b` | No public boundary crossed |
| Commitment inputs | `persistentCommit<Field>(secret, rand)` | Commitment cryptographically hides input |
| Exported circuit parameter used only internally | `lastHash = persistentCommit(amount, rand)` where `amount` is a circuit param | Param is a PLONK private input; raw value never enters the public transcript unless disclosed at a boundary |

## Safe Stdlib Routines

| Function | Signature | Cryptographically Hides Input? | Why |
|----------|-----------|----------------------|-----|
| `persistentCommit<T>` | `(value: T, rand: Bytes<32>): Bytes<32>` | **Yes** | Commitment cryptographically hides input |
| `transientCommit<T>` | `(value: T, rand: Field): Field` | **Yes** | Same hiding property, circuit-efficient |
| `persistentHash<T>` | `(value: T): Bytes<32>` | **No** | Hash could theoretically be brute-forced |
| `transientHash<T>` | `(value: T): Field` | **No** | Same reasoning as persistentHash |

Commit functions (`persistentCommit`, `transientCommit`) clear witness taint on both the input and the output. The commitment result does not carry witness taint, so `disclose()` is not required when storing it in ledger state. Hash functions (`persistentHash`, `transientHash`) do NOT clear taint — values derived from hashes still require `disclose()`.

```compact
const commitment = persistentCommit<Field>(secretValue, randomness);
storedCommitment = commitment;  // No disclose() needed — persistentCommit clears taint

const hash = persistentHash<Field>(secretValue);
storedHash = disclose(hash);  // disclose() required — persistentHash does NOT clear taint
```

## Common Disclosure Mistakes

| Wrong | Correct | Why |
|-------|---------|-----|
| `balance = getBalance()` | `balance = disclose(getBalance())` | Ledger write requires disclosure |
| `if (getFlag()) { ... }` | `if (disclose(getFlag())) { ... }` | Conditional requires disclosure |
| `return computeResult()` | `return disclose(computeResult())` | Exported circuit return requires disclosure |
| `disclose(getBalance()); ...; balance = x` | `balance = disclose(x)` | Disclose at disclosure point, not at source |
| `Set` for private membership | `MerkleTree` + ZK path proof | Set reveals which element is tested |
| Same domain for commitment and nullifier | Different domains | Same domain enables linking attack |
| `persistentHash(secret)` to "hide" witness | `persistentCommit(secret, rand)` | Hash doesn't clear witness taint; commit does |
