# Midnight Data Models

Midnight supports two distinct token paradigms: **UTXO-based ledger tokens** and **account-based contract tokens**. Choose based on privacy requirements and use case complexity.

## Quick Decision Guide

| Requirement | Use UTXO (Ledger Tokens) | Use Account (Contract Tokens) |
|-------------|--------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Privacy critical | Yes - independent, shieldable | Less native privacy than UTXO; shielded contract tokens in development |
| Parallel processing | Yes - no ordering deps | No - sequential nonce |
| Simple transfers | Yes | Overkill |
| Complex DeFi logic | Limited | Yes |
| Gaming state machines | No | Yes |
| Governance/delegation | No | Yes |

## UTXO Model (Ledger Tokens)

UTXO = Unspent Transaction Output. Each token is a discrete digital coin that must be spent entirely.

### Core Mechanics

```text
Creation -> Existence -> Consumption -> Prevention of Reuse
```

1. **Creation**: UTXO born with a cryptographic commitment that hides the coin's value, type, and owner
2. **Existence**: Queryable in the commitment tree
3. **Consumption**: Entire UTXO spent in transaction (change returned as new UTXO)
4. **Prevention**: Nullifier added to global set, prevents double-spend

### Nullifier Innovation

Unlike Bitcoin, which references prior outputs directly by txid+index (revealing which coin was spent), Midnight uses nullifiers:

Each coin carries a value, token type, and unique nonce. The nullifier is a hash derived from the coin data and the spending key.

**Privacy benefit**: The nullifier is computed from the raw coin data and the spending key, not from the commitment. This means the nullifier reveals nothing about which coin commitment was spent.

### Shielded vs Unshielded

Each UTXO independently chooses privacy level:
- **Shielded**: Commitment hidden, value/owner private
- **Unshielded**: Value visible for regulatory compliance

## Account Model (Contract Tokens)

Maintain address-to-balance mappings within Compact contracts, following patterns inspired by OpenZeppelin-style token standards adapted for Compact.

### When to Use

- Complex DeFi state machines requiring intricate interactions
- Gaming systems with stateful game logic
- Governance tokens with delegation mechanics
- Social tokens tracking relationships

### Trade-offs

| Aspect | Account Model Limitation |
|--------|-------------------------|
| Privacy | Less native privacy than UTXO; shielded contract tokens in development |
| Ordering | Nonce creates sequential dependency |
| MEV | Mempool visibility enables front-running |
| Scalability | Redundant computation on every node |

## Ledger Structure

Midnight's ledger has two components:

### 1. Zswap State
- **Commitment tree** — a Merkle tree of all coin commitments ever created
- **First free index** — pointer to the next available leaf position (append-only)
- **Nullifier set** — all spent-coin nullifiers, checked before accepting new spends
- **Historic roots** — recent Merkle roots kept for a time window so proofs can reference slightly older tree states

### 2. Contract Map
- Associates contract addresses with states
- Each contract state holds an Impact state value plus entry point operations (SNARK verifier keys)

## Token Types

Token types are 256-bit collision-resistant hashes:
- **Native token**: The type identifier is the 256-bit zero value
- **Custom tokens**: derived by hashing a domain separator with the issuing contract's address
