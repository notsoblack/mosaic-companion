# Basic Start: Your First Midnight DApp

A step-by-step procedural guide that takes you from zero to a working Midnight DApp on a local devnet. Each step builds on the previous one, verifying your environment works correctly along the way.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure:
- **Docker** is running (`docker info` should succeed)
- **Node.js 22+** is installed (`node --version`)
- **Compact CLI** is installed (`compact --version`) — if not, use `/midnight-tooling:install-cli`

Run `/midnight-tooling:doctor` to check all prerequisites at once.

## Working Directory

Create a temporary directory for this walkthrough. All generated files go here.

```bash
mkdir -p /tmp/midnight-basic-start && cd /tmp/midnight-basic-start
```

## Steps

Work through each step in order. Each step's reference file contains the full procedure.

| Step | Title | What It Verifies | Reference |
|------|-------|-----------------|-----------|
| 1 | Devnet Setup | Docker, node, indexer, proof server all running | `references/step-1-devnet-setup.md` |
| 2 | Compact CLI | Compiler and CLI installed and up to date | `references/step-2-compact-cli.md` |
| 3 | Wallet Setup | Wallet creation, NIGHT airdrop, DUST registration | `references/step-3-wallet-setup.md` |
| 4 | Counter Contract | Write, compile, deploy, and call a smart contract | `references/step-4-counter-contract.md` |
| 5 | Token Transfer | Programmatic NIGHT transfer between wallets | `references/step-5-token-transfer.md` |
| 6 | Ticket Contract | Privacy-preserving contract with commitments and nullifiers | `references/step-6-ticket-contract.md` |

## When something errors

**Your first stop for any error code or message is `/midnight-status-codes:lookup`.**
It decodes node rejections (e.g. `1010: Custom error: 117`), SDK/Effect errors,
Compact compiler diagnostics, proof-server and indexer errors, and more — telling
you what produced the error and how to fix it.

```
/midnight-status-codes:lookup 117      # a numeric node/ledger code
/midnight-status-codes:lookup NotNormalized   # an error name
```

Common early ones on a fresh devnet: **117** (NotNormalized — set a small
`additionalFeeOverhead`, see step 4/5) and **1010** (the Substrate envelope that
wraps the real `Custom(N)` cause). For environment problems, run
`/midnight-tooling:doctor`.

## When You're Done

Delete the temporary working directory:

```bash
rm -rf /tmp/midnight-basic-start
```

Stop the devnet if you no longer need it:

```
/midnight-tooling:devnet stop --remove-volumes
```
