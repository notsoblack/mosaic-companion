## Key Decisions (as of 2026-03-05)

### Architecture

- **Core (trusted) vs Sandbox (untrusted)** — fundamental split
- **Containers are NOT the security boundary** — Core enforcement is
- **Docker IS required for v1** — users must install it. "Not a hard requirement" means keep Docker code in the Launcher abstraction so it's swappable later
- **Container Launcher abstraction** — all Docker-specific code behind one interface. Swap to WASM/microVMs by implementing a new Launcher

### Communication

- **HTTP + access key** — containers expose HTTP server, MosAIc sends `/init?key=<uuid>`
- **No HTTPS needed** — all communication is localhost
- **No exposed ports** — Docker bridge network + access key prevents external access

### Security

- **Outbound gatekeeper required** — Docker network controls alone are NOT sufficient
- **Domain allowlist** in manifest — hard filtering for tools (Barry's recommendation)
- **NLP/content filtering** better suited for agent guardrails, not tools
- **DNS proxy + IP filtering** — leading approach for HTTPS domain enforcement

### Data

- **Tools are read-only** on shared data; writes ONLY to append-only **Chronicle**
- **Pre-materialization** — Core copies data into container's `/inputs:ro`
- **Data access logging** best-effort at Core boundary (not syscall-level in v1)

### Payments & Wallet

- **MosAIc creates wallets** — no import (users fund only what they're willing to lose)
- **Paid tool registry deferred** — focus on HyperCycle remote services (USDC on Base + TODA TDN)
- **Agent wallets** — future, agents can have own wallets inside containers

### Permissions

- **No runtime permission escalation** — must be declared in manifest
- **User approval required** before any tool installation
- **Warning escalation** — more permissions → more aggressive warnings
